# Backend / API Section

This section should detail the server-side logic, data handling, and the API that powers your frontend.

**Suggested Content Structure:**

**Backend Architecture**

* Briefly describe the architectural pattern you followed (e.g., Layered Architecture, elements of Clean Architecture, standard MVC API project structure).
* Emphasize key principles like **separation of concerns** and how different parts of the application handle specific responsibilities (e.g., data access, business logic, API endpoints).
* Example Sentence: "The backend follows a layered architecture pattern, ensuring a clear separation between data access, business logic, and API presentation layers for improved maintainability and testability."

**API Design Principles**

* State that the API is designed following **RESTful principles**.
* Mention using standard **HTTP verbs** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for resource manipulation and appropriate **HTTP status codes** (200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
* Example Sentence: "The API adheres to RESTful design principles, utilizing standard HTTP methods and status codes to provide a clear and predictable interface for interacting with application resources."

**Key Functionality**

* Describe the main responsibilities of the backend API. What data does it manage? What operations does it perform?
* Mention specific areas like:
  * Handling requests from the frontend.
  * Managing application data (projects, blog posts, categories, etc.).
  * Implementing business logic (data validation, transformations).
  * Secure data persistence via interaction with the database.
  * (If applicable) User authentication and authorization.
* Example Sentence: "The backend API is responsible for serving project and blog data to the frontend, handling data persistence through EF Core, and implementing core business logic. It provides endpoints for retrieving lists of projects, fetching individual project details, etc."

**Technology Choices**

* Reiterate the core technologies: **C#** and **.NET** (specify the version, e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET 8).
* **Explain why these technologies were chosen:**
  * Performance and scalability.
  * Robust and mature ecosystem.
  * Strong type safety of C#.
  * Extensive library support.
  * Familiarity and personal preference (it's okay to mention this!).
* Example Sentence: "The backend is built using C# and .NET 8, chosen for its strong performance characteristics, developer productivity, and the comprehensive ecosystem provided by the .NET framework, making it well-suited for building scalable web APIs."

**API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)**

* If you use Swagger/OpenAPI (which is standard in .NET APIs), this is a significant plus.
* Explain that the API is documented using **Swagger/OpenAPI**.
* Mention the benefits (interactive documentation, ability to test endpoints directly).
* **Provide a link** to the Swagger UI if it's publicly hosted, or explain how someone running the project locally can access it.
* Example Sentence: "The API is documented using Swagger (OpenAPI specification), providing interactive documentation where you can explore all available endpoints, their parameters, and expected responses. \[Link to Swagger UI - if public] / Instructions for local access: \[Brief instructions]."
