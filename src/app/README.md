# Welcome to My Portfolio Menno

**Welcome to My Full-Stack Portfolio Documentation**

Hello! I'm **Menno**, a Full-Stack Developer passionate about building robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications.

This documentation site serves as a comprehensive guide to my key portfolio projects, offering deeper insights into the technologies, architecture, and development practices behind them than a typical resume or project README alone.

* The **backend architecture** built with **C# .NET** and a **RESTful API**.
* The **frontend implementation** using **React Next JS** for dynamic user interfaces.
* Integration with **Azure SQL Database** for reliable data storage.
* My process for **automated CI/CD** using **GitHub Actions**, including database migrations and testing.

**Key Areas and Technologies Explored Here:**

* **Full-Stack Development:** Demonstrating the ability to work across both frontend and backend.
* **Backend Development:** Focusing on **C#** and the **.NET** ecosystem.
* **RESTful APIs:** Designing and implementing structured data access.

* **Azure Cloud:** Leveraging Azure services for hosting and data storage.

My goal is to demonstrate my proficiency across the entire development lifecycle, from database design and backend logic to frontend user experiences and automated deployment pipelines in cloud environments like Azure.
