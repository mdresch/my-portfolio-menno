# Quickstart My-Portfolio

## Welcome to Your Next.js Project

This project was bootstrapped with 'creste-next-app'.

### Getting Started

To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisties

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

* **Node.js:** This project requires Node.js (version 18 or later is recommended). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Node.js comes bundled with `npm`.
* **Git:** You'll need Git to clone the repository. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### 1. Get the Code

First, clone the project repository from its source (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, etc.). Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository and `<repository-name>` with the name of the directory created by cloning (usually derived from the repository URL).

````
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdresch/my-portfolio-menno.git
cd my-portfolio-menno
````

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Once you are in the project directory, install the necessary dependencies using your preferred package manager.

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

(Choose only one of the above commands based on the package manager you prefer to use).

#### 3. Run the Development Server

After installation, you can start the development server:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [**http://localhost:3000**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&q=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000) in your browser to see your app in action.

You can begin editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page will automatically update as you save your changes (Hot Module Replacement).

#### Font Optimization

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a modern font family designed for Vercel.

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvercel.com%2Fnew%3Futm_medium%3Ddefault-template%26filter%3Dnext.js%26utm_source%3Dcreate-next-app%26utm_campaign%3Dcreate-next-app-readme), created by the makers of Next.js.

For more details, see the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&q=https%3A%2F%2Fnextjs.org%2Fdocs%2Fdeployment).

To kick things off, start the development server with one of the following commands:

bash

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your app in action.

#### **Beautiful documentation starts with the content you create, and GitBook makes it effortless to work with both new and pre-existing content.**

* **Write from Scratch:** If you're new to creating content, check out our Basics section. It covers everything you need to know about writing great documentation from the ground up.
* **Import Existing Content:** Already have content? No problem. GitBook supports importing files from many popular writing tools and formats. Simply upload one or more files, and GitBook will import your content seamlessly.

### **Sync a Repository**

GitBook lets you set up a two-way sync with an existing GitHub or GitLab repository. With Git Sync enabled, you and your team can work seamlessly—editing your content directly in GitBook or writing in your code editor—while ensuring your documentation stays perfectly up-to-date across both platforms.
