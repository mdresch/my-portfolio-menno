# Publish your docs with Gitbook

### **Publish Your Docs with GitBook**

My portfolio site leverages GitBook to create and manage its documentation. With GitBook, you can easily publish, collaborate, and maintain up-to-date docs—all in one streamlined workflow. Whether you're writing directly in GitBook or syncing content with your GitHub or GitLab repository, GitBook ensures your documentation is always accessible and current.

The installation includes GitBook set up with synchronization to the "My Portfolio Menno" GitHub repository. Whenever GitBook submits an update, the repository automatically receives a git commit with the updated content.

Once you’ve finished writing, editing, or importing your content, you can publish your work to the web as a docs site. Once published, your site will be accessible online only to your selected audience.

You can publish your site and find related settings from your docs site's homepage.
