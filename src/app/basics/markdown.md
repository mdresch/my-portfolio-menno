# Markdown

GitBook supports a wide variety of content types and is built on Markdownâ€”meaning you can easily copy and paste any existing Markdown files directly into the editor!

Feel free to test it out by copying the Markdown below. Simply hover over the code block in the upper right, copy it, and paste it into a new line in your document.

```
# Heading

This is some paragraph text, with a [link](https://docs.gitbook.com) to our docs. 

## Heading 2

- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3
```

If you have multiple files, GitBook also makes it simple to import entire repositories. This allows you to keep your GitBook content synchronized with your existing documentation effortlessly.
