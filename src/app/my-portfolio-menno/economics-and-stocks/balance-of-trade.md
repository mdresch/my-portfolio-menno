# Balance of Trade

### Balance of Trade Dashboard (src\app\dashboards\balance-of-trade\page.tsx)

This document provides documentation for the BalanceOfTradeDashboard component, which displays information and insights related to international trade balances.

#### Overview

The BalanceOfTradeDashboard component renders a static dashboard-style page providing an overview of the balance of trade for selected major economies. It displays a table listing countries, their major foreign investors, and their reported trade deficits/surpluses. Additionally, the page includes sections offering economic insights into imports and exports and presents a poll result related to the causes of trade deficits.

#### File Location

The component is located within the Next.js App Router structure, nested under the dashboards directory:

```
      src/app/dashboards/balance-of-trade/page.tsx
    
```

#### Technologies Used

* **React:** Core component library.
* **Next.js (App Router):** Routing (page.tsx), Server Components (absence of 'use client').
* **TypeScript:** Provides type safety (indicated by .tsx extension).
* **Tailwind CSS:** Styling and layout via utility classes.

#### Server Component (Absence of 'use client')

Since the 'use client' directive is not present at the top of this file, this component is a **Server Component** by default. It renders on the server, which is suitable as the page primarily displays static data (tradeData) and informational text.

#### Imports

The component imports:

* import React from "react";: Standard React import for JSX.

#### Props

As an App Router page component (page.tsx), BalanceOfTradeDashboard does not accept external props.

#### State

This component is a static Server Component and does not use React state hooks (e.g., useState) or manage any internal, dynamic state.

#### Data Source (tradeData)

The page includes a hardcoded array of JavaScript objects, tradeData, directly within the component file.

```
      const tradeData = [
  {
    country: "United States",
    majorInvestors: ["Japan", "UK", "Canada", "Germany", "China"],
    tradeDeficit: "$-900B"
  },
  // ... more country data
];
    
```

This array serves as the data source for the table displayed on the page. In a real application, this data might be fetched from an API, database, or external file.

#### Structure and Rendering

The component renders a main element (using \<main> for semantic correctness) with standard page container styling (container mx-auto px-4 py-8). The content is structured into:

1. **Header (\<h1>):** The main title of the dashboard ("Balance of Trade Dashboard").
2. **Introduction (\<p>):** A brief description of the dashboard's content.
3. **Trade Data Table (div with overflow-x-auto containing \<table>):**
   * A wrapper div to ensure horizontal scrolling on small screens if needed.
   * A \<table> displays the tradeData.
   * The table has a header (\<thead>) with columns for "Country", "Major Foreign Investors", and "Trade Deficit".
   * The table body (\<tbody>) maps over the tradeData array. Each object in the array renders a table row (\<tr>).
   * Cells (\<td>) display the country name (bold), the comma-separated list of major investors, and the trade deficit/surplus value.
4. **Imports Insights Section (\<section>):** A styled block (my-8 p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded) providing informational insights into the economics of goods and services imports and their economic impacts, using nested headings and bulleted lists.
5. **Exports Insights Section (\<section>):** A styled block (my-8 p-6 bg-green-50 rounded) providing informational insights into the economics of goods and services exports and their economic impacts, using nested headings and bulleted lists.
6. **Trade Deficit Causes Poll Section (\<section>):** A styled block (my-8 p-6 bg-yellow-50 rounded) posing a question about the causes of trade deficits.
   * Lists potential causes using a bulleted list.
   * Includes a nested styled div (w-full max-w-md mx-auto containing bg-white rounded shadow p-4) to display simulated poll results for each cause with percentages.

#### Styling

Styling is handled using **Tailwind CSS** utility classes applied via the className attribute. Key styling features include:

* **Layout & Spacing:** container, mx-auto, px-, py-, mb-, my-, p-, ml-6, max-w-md, mx-auto, overflow-x-auto.
* **Typography:** text-3xl, font-bold, text-gray-700, text-2xl, font-semibold, text-xl, mb-1, font-semibold.
* **Backgrounds, Borders, Shadows:** bg-gray-100, border, border-gray-300, bg-blue-50, rounded, bg-green-50, bg-yellow-50, bg-white, shadow.
* **Table Styling:** min-w-full, px-, py-, border, text-left, text-xs, font-medium, uppercase, tracking-wider.
* **List Styling:** list-disc.
* **Flexbox:** flex, items-center, justify-between used for the poll results layout.

The page uses distinct background colors for different sections (bg-blue-50, bg-green-50, bg-yellow-50) to visually separate content areas, and standard table styling for the data display.

#### Key Content Covered

The page presents a static dashboard view focusing on trade balances and related economic concepts:

* A table showing major foreign investors and trade balances for a list of countries.
* Informational insights into the economics of imports (goods, services, impacts).
* Informational insights into the economics of exports (goods, services, impacts).
* Discussion and poll results on potential causes of trade deficits.

#### Usage

As a page.tsx file located at src/app/dashboards/balance-of-trade, the Next.js App Router automatically creates a route for this component. It will be accessible via the URL /dashboards/balance-of-trade.

This page is typically linked from the main Dashboards landing page (/dashboards) or other relevant sections of the documentation site.

```
      // Located at src/app/dashboards/balance-of-trade/page.tsx
// Automatically routes to /dashboards/balance-of-trade
    
```
