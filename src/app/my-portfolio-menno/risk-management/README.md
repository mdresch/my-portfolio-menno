# Risk Management

### Risk Management Page (pages/risk/page.tsx)

This document provides detailed information about the RiskPage component, which serves as the main landing page for Risk Management content on the documentation site.

#### Overview

The RiskPage component renders the comprehensive Risk Management page. It provides an overview of global risk challenges, highlights key reports and insights (like the World Risk Review), discusses trade issues, and acts as a hub linking to various detailed articles, reports, and solutions related to risk management. It also includes an interactive map component to visualize regional risks.

#### Technologies Used

* **React:** Core component library.
* **Next.js:** Routing and client-side navigation (next/link).
* **Tailwind CSS:** Styling and layout via utility classes.
* **InteractiveRiskMap (Custom Component):** Used to display a visual representation of regional risks.

#### File Location

Assumed location within the Next.js project's pages directory (or app directory depending on project structure, though the pages directory structure is implied by pages/risk.js):

```
pages/risk/page.tsx
```

content\_copydownloadUse code [with caution](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/13505487).

#### Imports

The component relies on the following imports:

* import React from 'react';: Standard React import for JSX.
* import Link from 'next/link';: Used for efficient client-side navigation to internal pages without full page reloads.
* import InteractiveRiskMap from '@/components/risk/InteractiveRiskMap';: Imports a custom component responsible for rendering the interactive map. The @/ alias is used here, pointing to the project's root directory (/).

#### Props

This component is a page component and does not accept any external props. Its content and layout are static, though child components (like InteractiveRiskMap) might handle their own internal state or props.

#### Structure and Rendering

The RiskPage component renders a main div container with padding and centering classes (container mx-auto px-4 py-12). Inside this container, the page is structured into several distinct sections, each represented by HTML semantic elements like \<header> and \<section>, further styled with Tailwind CSS:

1. **Header (\<header>):** Contains the main page title ("Navigating Global Risk") and a descriptive subtitle.
2. **Introduction & World Risk Review (\<section>):**
   * Provides introductory text on the importance of risk management.
   * Includes a highlighted section (bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500) introducing the "World Risk Review" report.
   * Lists key benefits/uses of leveraging the report using a bulleted list (\<ul>).
   * Contains an optional commented-out Link for accessing a full report.
   * Ends with a small concluding text.
3. **Wide-Ranging Trade Issues (\<section>):**
   * Focuses specifically on global trade challenges, supply chains, and M\&A within the current geopolitical context.
   * Consists of multiple paragraphs discussing these issues.
4. **Trade Insights Collection (\<section>):**
   * Promotes a collection of trade-related insights.
   * Includes text describing the collection and a "Contact Our Team" Link button.
5. **Explore Key Risk Areas, Insights & Solutions (\<section>):**
   * This is the core content hub, presenting various related articles, reports, studies, and solutions as cards.
   * Uses a CSS Grid (grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6) to lay out the cards responsively (single column on small screens, two columns on medium and larger screens).
   * Each card (div with styling like bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6) represents a link to related content.
   * Cards include a title (\<h3>), descriptive text (\<p>), and a navigation Link (\<a> styled as a link).
   * Some cards feature colored left borders (border-l-4) and labels ("NEW", "FEATURED", "CASE STUDY") to highlight specific types of content.
6. **Interactive Map (\<section id="interactive-map">):**
   * Displays a section dedicated to visualizing regional risk hotspots.
   * Includes a title and descriptive text.
   * Renders the InteractiveRiskMap component, which is responsible for the map's functionality and display. A note clarifies that the data is illustrative.
7. **Back to Home Link (\<div>):** A simple Link at the bottom of the page to navigate back to the homepage.

#### Styling

Styling is entirely handled by **Tailwind CSS** utility classes applied directly to JSX elements via the className attribute. This includes:

* Layout (e.g., container, mx-auto, grid, gap, flex, flex-col)
* Spacing (e.g., px-4, py-12, mb-, mt-, space-y-)
* Typography (e.g., text-4xl, font-bold, text-gray-800, leading-relaxed)
* Colors (e.g., bg-white, bg-blue-50, border-blue-500, text-gray-700, text-blue-600)
* Borders and Shadows (e.g., rounded-lg, shadow-md, border-l-4)
* Responsive Design (e.g., md:grid-cols-2)

Specific visual treatments like the blue border and background for the "Insights from the 2025 World Risk Review" block, and the colored left borders (border-l-4) on some content cards, are implemented using Tailwind classes.

#### Key Features

* **Centralized Risk Content:** Serves as a single page to access various articles, reports, and resources on global risk.
* **Structured Layout:** Content is organized into logical sections for readability.
* **Content Cards:** Utilizes a grid of visually distinct cards to link to related content pieces, making navigation easy.
* **Highlighting:** Uses "NEW", "FEATURED", and "CASE STUDY" labels with border colors to draw attention to specific content.
* **Internal Navigation:** Uses next/link for smooth client-side transitions to other pages within the site.
* **Interactive Map Integration:** Includes a dedicated section for a visual, interactive component (InteractiveRiskMap).

#### Usage

As a Next.js page component, RiskPage is typically placed in the pages (or app) directory. If located at src/app/risk/page.tsx, Next.js automatically creates a route /risk that renders this component.

```
// This component is automatically routed by Next.js
// when placed in src/app/risk/page.tsx (or app/risk/page.js)

// Access this page by navigating to /risk
```

#### Dependencies

* react
* next
* @/components/risk/InteractiveRiskMap
