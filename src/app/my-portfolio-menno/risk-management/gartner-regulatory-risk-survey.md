# Gartner Regulatory Risk Survey

***

### Gartner Regulatory Risk Survey Page (src\app\risk\gartner-regulatory-risk-survey\page.tsx)

This document provides detailed information about the GartnerRegulatoryRiskSurveyPage component, which presents a summary of a Gartner survey on emerging risks.

#### Overview

The GartnerRegulatoryRiskSurveyPage component renders a static content page summarizing findings from a Gartner survey regarding top emerging risks for Q1 2025. It highlights that an unsettled regulatory and legal environment is the top concern, discusses its root causes and potential consequences, and outlines key policy areas for risk assessment. The page is formatted as an article or press release summary.

#### File Location

The component is located within the Next.js App Router structure:

```
      src/app/risk/gartner-regulatory-risk-survey/page.tsx
    
```

#### Technologies Used

* **React:** Core component library.
* **Next.js (App Router):** Routing and client-side navigation (next/link), Image optimization (next/image - imported but not used in provided code).
* **Tailwind CSS:** Styling and layout via utility classes.
* **TypeScript:** Provides type safety (indicated by .tsx extension).
* **@tailwindcss/typography plugin:** Used via the prose class to style the main content block (paragraph, headings, lists, etc.).
* 'use client': Directive allowing for client-side features.

#### 'use client' Directive

The 'use client' directive is included at the top of the file. This indicates that the component is a Client Component. While the current code primarily renders static content, this directive allows the component to utilize browser APIs, React Hooks, or handle user interactions if future updates add dynamic features like interactive charts or data loading on the client-side.

#### Imports

The component imports:

* import React from 'react';: Standard import for using React and JSX.
* import Link from 'next/link';: Used for creating efficient client-side navigation links to other pages within the application (/risk).
* import Image from 'next/image';: Imported, presumably for potential use in embedding images (like the chart visualization), but it is not used in the provided code snippet.

#### Props

As an App Router page component (page.tsx), GartnerRegulatoryRiskSurveyPage does not accept external props passed directly from parent components in the traditional React sense.

#### State

Based on the provided code, the GartnerRegulatoryRiskSurveyPage component does not use React state hooks (e.g., useState) and therefore does not manage any internal, dynamic state.

#### Structure and Rendering

The component renders a main div container (container mx-auto px-4 py-8). The content is structured as follows:

1. **Header (\<header>):**
   * Includes a "Back to Risk Management" Link with an SVG arrow icon.
   * Contains a styled block (bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg) with the Gartner Research label, the main article title (\<h1>), a subtitle (\<p>), and date/location information.
2. **Main Content Wrapper (div with max-w-3xl mx-auto):** This div centers and constrains the width of the main article body.
   * **Prose Block (div with prose prose-lg):** This is the primary content area, using the @tailwindcss/typography plugin to automatically style the HTML elements within it (paragraphs, headings, lists, blockquotes, etc.) for better readability.
     * Initial paragraphs introducing the survey findings.
     * **Chart Placeholder:** A styled div block (bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg) indicating where a chart visualization ("Figure 1") will be implemented. It contains a placeholder div with text.
     * Expert quote paragraph.
     * Subheadings (\<h2>) for "Root Causes", "Potential Consequences", and "Assessing Risk Exposure".
     * Paragraphs explaining the points under each subheading.
     * A styled div block (my-6 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg) containing a numbered list (\<ol>) detailing the four critical policy areas for risk assessment. The list items themselves contain nested paragraphs.
     * Another expert quote paragraph.
     * **Additional Resources Block:** A styled div (my-8 bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6) linking to the full Gartner study for clients and non-clients.
     * Sections (\<h2> with paragraphs) providing information "About the Gartner Enterprise Risk, Audit & Compliance Conference" and "About Gartner for Legal, Risk & Compliance Leaders".
   * **Contact Information:** A styled div block (mt-10 mb-8 border-t border-gray-200 pt-6) containing press contact details.
   * **Navigation Button:** A div with justify-between containing a "Back to Risk Management" Link, styled as a button/link.

#### Styling

Styling relies heavily on **Tailwind CSS** utility classes applied via the className attribute. Key styling considerations:

* **Layout & Spacing:** container, mx-auto, px-, py-, mb-, mt-, gap-, flex, items-center, justify-between, max-w-.
* **Typography:** text-4xl, font-bold, text-gray-800, text-xl, text-gray-700, text-sm, text-gray-500, font-semibold, uppercase (used in comments, not on H2s in code), prose prose-lg. The prose class automatically styles the internal text elements, providing standard article formatting.
* **Backgrounds, Borders, Shadows:** bg-gray-50, bg-white, rounded-lg, shadow-sm, shadow-md, border, border-gray-200, border-l-4, border-blue-500, border-t.
* **Lists:** Standard list classes (list-disc, list-inside, list-decimal). The prose class also contributes to list styling within its block.

The use of the prose class simplifies styling for the main body text by applying predefined typographical rules based on standard HTML elements. Other elements outside the prose block are styled explicitly with Tailwind classes.

#### Key Content Covered

The page serves as a summary of a Gartner report, highlighting:

* Regulatory and legal environment as the top emerging risk for Q1 2025.
* The impact of recent and upcoming elections on regulatory landscapes.
* Challenges posed by divergent global approaches to AI regulation.
* Potential consequences of regulatory uncertainty, including shifts in scrutiny and evolving compliance costs.
* Four critical policy areas businesses should assess for risk exposure: Trade, Regulatory/Legal Volatility, Geopolitical Landscape, and Immigration/Workforce.
* Mention of additional resources for accessing the full report and information about related Gartner events and services.

#### Usage

As a page.tsx file located at src/app/risk/gartner-regulatory-risk-survey, the Next.js App Router automatically creates a route for this component. It will be accessible via the URL /risk/gartner-regulatory-risk-survey.

This page is typically linked to from other relevant pages on the documentation site, such as the main Risk Management overview page (/risk).

```
      // Located at src/app/risk/gartner-regulatory-risk-survey/page.tsx
// Automatically routes to /risk/gartner-regulatory-risk-survey
    
```
