        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
          <li>Goods imports are physical products purchased from abroad, such as machinery, vehicles, electronics, and raw materials.</li>
          <li>They provide access to products not produced domestically or available at lower prices due to comparative advantage.</li>
          <li>High goods imports can indicate strong domestic demand but may lead to trade deficits if not balanced by exports.</li>
          <li>Over-reliance on imported goods can expose an economy to global supply chain disruptions and currency fluctuations.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Services imports include intangible products such as financial services, tourism, software, consulting, and education.</li>
          <li>They enhance domestic productivity, provide specialized expertise, and support sectors like tourism and IT.</li>
          <li>Service imports are increasingly important in advanced economies and can help offset goods trade deficits.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-1 text-gray-900 dark:text-blue-100">Economic Impacts</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
          <li>Imports increase consumer choice, lower costs, and drive innovation through competition.</li>
          <li>Persistent trade deficits may lead to increased foreign debt or currency depreciation, but can also reflect investment inflows and economic openness.</li>
          <li>Balancing imports with competitive exports is key to sustainable economic growth.</li>

        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
          <li>Goods exports are physical products sold to foreign countries, such as machinery, vehicles, agricultural products, and electronics.</li>
          <li>Exporting goods allows domestic producers to access larger markets, achieve economies of scale, and increase revenues.</li>
          <li>Strong goods exports can improve a country&apos;s trade balance, support job creation, and stimulate economic growth.</li>
          <li>Dependence on a narrow range of export goods or markets can expose an economy to global price fluctuations and demand shocks.</li>

          <li>Services exports include intangible products such as financial services, IT, tourism, education, and consulting provided to foreign clients.</li>
          <li>They are a growing part of global trade, especially for advanced economies with strong knowledge and technology sectors.</li>
          <li>Services exports can help diversify the economy, reduce reliance on goods exports, and generate high-value jobs.</li>

          <li>Exports drive economic growth, support innovation, and enhance competitiveness in global markets.</li>
          <li>Trade surpluses from strong exports can strengthen a country&apos;s currency and improve its financial position.</li>
