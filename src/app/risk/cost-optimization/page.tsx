        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
          Cost optimization is the strategic, ongoing process of reducing and managing expenses while maximizing value, efficiency, and business performance. Unlike one-off cost cutting, cost optimization is a continuous, business-focused discipline that aligns spending with business objectives, improves operational efficiency, and frees up resources for future value.
