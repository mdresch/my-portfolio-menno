          <p className="mb-4">Engaging a disruptive rebel in a business context can be both a risk and an opportunity. While such individuals often challenge the status quo and drive innovation, their approach may also create friction within established boundaries and processes.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What is a Disruptive Rebel?</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">A disruptive rebel is someone who questions existing norms, introduces unconventional ideas, and is willing to take risks to achieve breakthrough results. In the context of business boundaries, this can mean pushing against traditional roles, hierarchies, or market limitations.</p>

          <p className="mb-4">Disruptive rebels maximize efficiency by adopting and integrating cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and advanced analytics. By staying at the forefront of tech innovation, they streamline operations, enhance decision-making, and unlock new business opportunities. Organizations should encourage the exploration and responsible use of emerging technologies to maintain a competitive edge and drive sustainable growth.</p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Best Practice: Redefine Roles</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">No one can expect the job they have today to remain unchanged forever. Savvy organizations like the WMACs are responding by creating more flexible org charts and seeking out talent with more adaptable skills.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Many best-in-class companies are replacing rigid job descriptions with job architectures that allow for quick and cost-effective adaptation when human capital needs change.</p>
          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-400 pl-4 italic mb-2">“Organizations are not necessarily hiring for fixed roles. They are looking at the work that needs to be done and the skills people need to do it,” says Manson-Smith.</blockquote>
          <p className="mb-4">Because of that, they can move people around more quickly as needs evolve. WMACs are also actively adjusting the skills and competencies they hire for, prioritizing skills like agility, curiosity, and the ability to learn and apply new things as much as, if not more than, experiences and education.</p>
          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-400 pl-4 italic mb-2">“They’re asking, ‘Can we count on you to be adaptable and agile in the way you operate?’” Royal explains. “It’s a much more forward-looking way of hiring.”</blockquote>
          <p className="mb-4">And they’re extending that outlook to the professional development of existing employees as well.</p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How to Fail Fast</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">This year’s WMACs (World’s Most Admired Companies) are not only agile in capturing opportunities—they also bounce back quickly from failure. Even the most meticulously thought-through strategy will fall flat sometimes. It happens to everyone—including some of the largest and most admired companies in the world.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">WMACs tend to be culturally oriented to tolerate risk and failure. They recognize that when you are agile and curious, and you step outside of comfortable boundaries, you might not always get the result you want.</p>
          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-400 pl-4 italic mb-2">“WMACs are likely to view well-chosen risks that don’t pan out as learning opportunities.”<br/>— Mark Royal, Korn Ferry, Rebels with a Plan: Why the Best Companies are Disruptive</blockquote>
          <p className="mb-4">Here are three tenets WMACs employ to fail faster:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Make it Safe:</strong> Unless there’s misconduct at play, there is no need to penalize people whose new projects don’t work out. “Experimenting means allowing people to fail sometimes,” says Manson-Smith.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn From It:</strong> Conduct a quick postmortem to better understand what went wrong. WMACs are likely to view well-chosen risks that don’t pan out as learning opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Move On:</strong> Don’t dwell on past missteps. In the words of Samuel Beckett, “Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”</li>

          <p className="mb-4">No organization becomes change-ready overnight. It takes effort to prepare management and employee teams to manage transformation. On this, WMACs are ahead of the pack. Their tactics vary but tend to complement the six transformational mindsets Korn Ferry has identified as helpful in developing change-ready organizations. We call it <strong>ADAPTS</strong>:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Anticipate the Unexpected:</strong> Dispel workplace complacency and proactively look for early hints of changes to come.</li>
            <li><strong>Diversity of Perspectives:</strong> Challenge established assumptions and seek alternative interpretations, driving innovation through diverse thinking.</li>
            <li><strong>Anchor on Purpose:</strong> Assess new situations from the purpose lens, turning disruptions into opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Progress over Perfection:</strong> Adopt an action-oriented approach, learning through doing and acting quickly to seize new opportunities rather than focusing solely on perfection.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust to Partner:</strong> Rely on collective intelligence, bringing together knowledge, experience, and intuition from across the organization to respond to unexpected situations.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustain the Organization:</strong> Demonstrate the ability to maintain operations while adapting to new challenges and changes.</li>

          <p className="mb-4">When asked to reflect on how the changing workplace has impacted them personally, top responses among WMAC executives were:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>“I feel positive about the impact our company is having and my role in it.”</li>

          <p className="mb-4">Disruptive organizations need disruptive leadership. As you prepare to steer your organization towards a more innovative, agile, and change-ready future, experts recommend asking yourself three key questions:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Am I stuck in the success trap?</strong> “WMAC leaders are not captive to past success,” Royal explains. “They show a willingness to adapt and adjust despite past track records that might encourage them to just stay the course. They don’t assume what worked in the past will work in the future.”</li>
            <li><strong>Am I connecting the dots?</strong> “The best leaders look across all dimensions of what drives organizational performance, and they consider it all together,” says Manson-Smith. “They have a very clear growth strategy, and they really focus on aligning the whole organization to support it.”</li>
            <li><strong>Am I a team player?</strong> “Collaboration runs through a lot of what is involved in disruption,” says Royal. “Leaders have to think with an enterprise mindset about opportunities and challenges. That means asking, ‘Am I really as connected and collaborative as I can be to help the organization thrive?’”</li>

          <h5 className="text-md font-semibold mb-2">Moments of Risk Factors</h5>
          <p className="mb-4">Specific instances or conditions where risks are most likely to materialize, such as market volatility, default occurrences, or regulatory changes.</p>
          <h5 className="text-md font-semibold mb-2">Dimensions of Risk Factors</h5>
          <p className="mb-4">Geographical, sector-specific, quantitative, and temporal dimensions were highlighted, along with systemic connections between risks.</p>
          <h5 className="text-md font-semibold mb-2">Methods to Identify and Model Risks</h5>
          <p className="mb-4"><strong>Understanding Dependencies and Correlations:</strong> Risk factors are interdependent (e.g., inflation driving interest rates, geopolitical events affecting currencies and commodities). Models like copulas and survival copulas capture correlations and joint behaviors of risk factors, especially for extreme events.</p>
          <h5 className="text-md font-semibold mb-2">Modeling Techniques</h5>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Factor Models:</strong> Simplify complex systems by linking observed risks to a few latent factors. Assume conditional independence to focus on shared drivers like macroeconomic variables.</li>
            <li><strong>Marshall-Olkin Model:</strong> Models dependent defaults using systematic and idiosyncratic shocks. Provides clarity on simultaneous or cascading defaults in credit risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Monte Carlo Methods:</strong> Use random sampling and simulation to model uncertainty and estimate joint risk profiles.</li>
            <li><strong>Transformation of PDFs:</strong> Reframe the distributions of variables to create tailored models fitting unique dependencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Copula Functions:</strong> Allow separation of marginal risk distributions from dependency structures. Include Gaussian, Student-t, Clayton, and Gumbel copulas, each suited to different tail dependencies.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5 className="text-md font-semibold mb-2">Calibration and Validation</h5>
          <p className="mb-4">Calibration of models using historical data or market prices ensures relevance and accuracy. Stress testing and scenario analysis are vital for understanding the impact of extreme dependencies.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">This conversation highlights the intricacies of identifying and managing risks in structured finance. It emphasizes the importance of detailed, multidimensional modeling to ensure accurate representations of dependencies and correlations.</p>
