      <h1>Pricing Under Tariffs: Risk and Resilience Strategies</h1>
      <p>
        Tariffs are causing significant pricing pressure, delayed orders, and customers seeking alternatives. Leading companies are responding with a mix of pricing and non-pricing strategies to protect margins and maintain competitiveness.
      </p>
      <h2>Key Strategies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Unbundling non-dutiable costs (e.g., marketing, brand services) to reduce customs value</li>
        <li>Product reclassification and minor modifications to lower duty rates</li>
        <li>Adjusting transfer pricing models to minimize margin compression</li>
        <li>Cross-functional tactics: reclassifying goods, accelerating shipments, rerouting, and tariff engineering</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Customer and Product Focus</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Not all customers or products should be treated equallyâ€”focus support on key accounts and high-margin or resilient products</li>
        <li>Use a 2x2 matrix (product resilience vs. margin) to tailor actions for each segment</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Step-by-Step Framework</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Map Exposure:</strong> Identify impacted products, customers, and quantify risk</li>
        <li><strong>Assess Portfolio Fundamentals:</strong> Evaluate product differentiation, price sensitivity, and gross margins</li>
        <li><strong>Define Response Tactics:</strong> Use data-driven insights to select the right mix of pricing and operational levers</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Commercial Readiness</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Agility and data-driven decision-making are crucial for commercial readiness, not just crisis response</li>
        <li>Embed pricing and risk frameworks into daily operations for long-term resilience</li>
      </ul>
