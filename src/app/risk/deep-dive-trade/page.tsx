          Trade is the lifeblood of the global economy. But due to its breadth and scope, it unsurprisingly faces several significant challenges — often interconnected and mutually reinforcing — including geopolitical instability, increasing economic tensions, inflation, climate change, currency fluctuations and people availability. Together, these create a complex and volatile global trade landscape for business leaders to navigate.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            In addition to the movement of goods and commodities, the role of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is significant in shaping the landscape for global trade. Deal flows continue to accelerate as demand increases and capital comes back into play, according to Aon’s 2025 Deal Market View. Following the U.S. elections, expectations are widespread that M&A activity will increase, however, questions remain on how potential tariffs and trade wars will impact the market.<sup className="text-xs">6</sup>
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            According to Aon’s Global Risk Management Survey, dealmakers and risk managers consider the top five financial risks to be:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-6 pl-4 text-sm">
            <li>Cash flow or liquidity risk</li>

          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Macroeconomic volatility and increasingly complex regulatory regimes have affected M&A market dynamics over the past two years. Access to capital has become increasingly challenging, with elevated interest rates making the cost of borrowing more expensive.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            All things considered, M&A momentum is demonstrating remarkable resilience to today’s macro pressures, according to Aon’s The ABCs of Private Equity M&A report. In a survey of senior executives from corporate development teams and private equity firms, most respondents expect deal activity to increase in the next 12 months.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Specifically, more than 60 percent expect a strong or moderate rise, driven by improving market conditions and capital availability. After several years of a challenging regulatory environment for M&A, regulatory agencies are widely expected to be more receptive to combinations that meet the required statutory factors, as well as reducing burdens for new entrants. Reducing burdens and a more predictable review process will likely result in shorter deal timelines, which in turn, can increase deal activity.
          </p>
          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-6">
            “Macro factors were indeed squeezing clients and creating headwinds for M&A. But over the last more than 12 months, we've been seeing the market rebound as the volatility coming from those factors subsides. Moreover, anticipated tax legislation is in the U.S. and trade uncertainties do not yet appear to be insurmountable headwinds.”

            This should bode well for broader trade dynamics. M&A is being further bolstered by sellers having more options to achieve exits through IPOs and corporate sales; however, secondaries continue to provide a vehicle for liquidity. The accelerated M&A activity is supported by significant dry powder at financial sponsors and a backlog of companies ready for sale.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
