            The Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has released its Business Plan for 2025-26, highlighting key areas of focus related to payment systems, digital money, and the security of legal tender in the United Kingdom. This analysis explores the emerging risks to the UK's monetary system, the regulatory measures being implemented to preserve the value and security of legal payment tender, and strategies to prevent counterfeit currency from gaining traction in illegal payment settlements.

              The concept of legal tender in the UK centers around the official currency—Bank of England notes and Royal Mint coins—as the legally recognized medium for settling debts. As of May 2025, the UK faces several challenges in maintaining the integrity of its currency system.

            The PRA is developing policy to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) standard on banks' cryptoassets exposures in the UK. This regulatory framework aims to establish clear boundaries between traditional legal tender and digital assets, ensuring that cryptoassets do not undermine the stability of the established monetary system.

            Following the events of March 2023, which saw significant deposit outflows from institutions like Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse, the PRA has implemented changes to how firms access sterling central bank reserves. In 2025, the Bank's operating framework will transition to a demand-driven repo-led framework, with the stock of sterling reserves determined by firms' borrowing rather than by extraordinary monetary policy operations.

            The Bank of England is advancing its work on a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC), the "digital pound," which would serve as an official digital complement to physical banknotes. This initiative aims to ensure that the Bank maintains monetary sovereignty in an increasingly digital financial landscape while offering a secure alternative to private digital currencies that might otherwise challenge the primacy of legal tender.

          The Bank of England's PRA Business Plan 2025-26 demonstrates a comprehensive approach to protecting the status and security of legal payment tender in the UK.

        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 transition-colors">
          Financial institutions, payment service providers, and businesses handling currency should pay close attention to the evolving regulatory framework and take proactive measures to enhance their anti-counterfeiting capabilities and ensure compliance with the emerging rules governing both physical and digital money.
