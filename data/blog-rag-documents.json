    "content": "*Nowadays, I am once again engaged with the issues related to the extent of educational guidance and the development and composition of our environment. The objectives are understandable, and especially in the field of environmental concerns and climate, there are moments when we should look back at the results achieved. In the past, there were enough important events that, nowadays, we no longer see with the same urgency and scale as when they were first introduced. In particular, the reports about “acid rain” and the “ozone layer,” where a hole was discovered, were topics that once led to significant changes in direction. These events prompted important adjustments regarding the availability of ozone in our products.*\r\n\r\n*It appears that the current urgency for improvements in the environment driven by climate goals is somewhat lacking. For the most part, we have not achieved these goals; we do not have a truly livable climate even though we work so hard to reach it. There is a stark contrast in motivation—a desire for a future that is livable versus the reality that despite our hard work and determination, the goal may remain unreachable. The ozone layer is no longer given the importance it once had in the articles. There is an implication that these objectives, through changes in our behavior, are now directly leading to improvements in the environment and that these goals still matter. A similar suggestion is made with “acid rain,” implying that such heavy rain might feel as painful as tears in those countries. Nowadays, there is little discussion about acid rain; the rain that falls no longer feels painful but just like water, suggesting that even these issues are now considered as having been resolved or achieved.*\r\n\r\nYour text touches upon a core problem: the interplay between historical environmental challenges and the current urgency surrounding climate change. In the past—think of the concerns over acid rain and the ozone hole—we witnessed that when society was confronted with visible, immediate environmental problems, there was a massive mobilization of policy and public awareness. Back then, these issues led to concrete policy changes, such as the introduction of stricter regulations and international treaties that truly made a difference. Today, however, the debate often seems more muted, and the emotional and societal urgency of that era is less palpable.\r\n\r\nThis shift raises an important question: how can we reignite the power of educational outreach to drive the necessary behavioral change? It isn’t merely a matter of presenting facts and figures—it is also about sharing stories and evoking emotions that resonate with people. While we now face gloomy forecasts about the climate crisis, the rhetoric of immediate, tangible threats that once ignited collective action has diminished. A renewed communication strategy could, for example, combine historical lessons with today’s challenges, thereby both informing and inspiring the public.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate these differences more clearly, consider the following comparative overview:\r\n\r\n| **Environmental Issue** | **Historical Impact** | **Policy Change** | **Emotional Response** |\r\n| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |\r\n| **Acid Rain** | Devastated ecosystems and caused damage to buildings | Stricter regulations on industrial emissions | Immediate shock and widespread societal mobilization |\r\n| **Ozone Layer Depletion** | Increased risk of skin cancer due to elevated UV exposure | International cooperation (e.g., the Montreal Protocol) to restore the ozone layer | A strong sense of urgency and awareness about environmental care |\r\n| **Current Climate Change** | Long-term effects such as extreme weather patterns and sea-level rise | New policy frameworks focusing on renewable energy and a circular economy | A more abstract concern, with growing but less visceral public anxiety |\r\n\r\nThis table shows how concrete threats in the past prompted decisive action, while the more diffuse, long-term threats of today may lack the same emotional punch, which can lead to a disconnect between our hard work and the reality of achieving a livable environment.\r\n\r\nYour reflection invites us to think more deeply about the balance between behavior change, policy ambitions, and the role of education in fostering a collective sense of urgency. What methods do you believe would best recapture the emotional intensity and impact that once energized the environmental debate? Consider innovative media formats, experiential education programs, or local initiatives that bridge the gap between scientific data and everyday life.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, looking at historical successes or international examples might offer fresh inspiration. Discussions on sustainable development, circular economies, and the energy transition provide ample room for innovative approaches in communicating environmental goals. How can we, for instance, use intergenerational dialogue—where youth and older generations collaborate and share their visions—to bridge the gap between historical lessons and our present-day challenges?\r\n\r\nIn light of these questions, what do you see as the crucial steps to overcome the current divide between our determined efforts to reach a goal and the persistent reality of living in an environment that is rapidly changing?\r\n\r\nI hope this translation and the English version of the response capture the essence of your original reflective exploration. Would you like to delve deeper into any specific aspect—such as potential communication strategies or historical case studies—that could further enhance this discussion?",

    "content": "In a globally connected world, it is no secret that international trade is the key to climbing the ladder of success at a faster pace. More and more businesses are now looking to expand their reach beyond borders in order to explore growth-accelerating opportunities. These new and promising avenues have the potential to help businesses establish a strong global presence.\r\nHowever, there are certain challenges and risks in international business that organizations need to be aware of, especially when navigating overseas markets for the first time. Considering international business risk factors is a mandatory step. It can help businesses predict certain complications, and avoid the hefty costs to address them. In this blog, we will address the **risks in international trade**, as well as how to mitigate these risks in international trade:\r\n\r\n**Types of Risks in International Trade & Ways to Tackle Them** \r\n\r\n***1\\. Credit Risks:*** \r\nAlso referred to as counterparty risks, these challenges related to credit can arise if your trading partners fail to deliver on their part – be it in terms of accounts receivable, product delivery, or any other differences that arise during the assignment.\r\n\r\nCertain measures can be put in place to protect the business from commercial risks in international trade like non-payment or delayed deliveries. Here are some examples: vendors can take payment in full or a fair percentage before delivering the products. One of the most effective ways is leveraging a letter of credit. It can help create a sense of security among buyers and sellers involved in a project.\r\n\r\n***2\\. Legal Risks:*** \r\nLegal risks in international trade can arise due to foreign rules and regulations. Each country has its own set of laws. When venturing into new international markets, businesses have to first get well-acquainted with different commercial laws, as well as import and export allowances of the particular country.\r\n\r\nIt is important to keep track of all the rules as legal proceedings often come with hefty charges. In addition, it helps to get the products verified, as well as get an export certificate. Legal risks can be best avoided by appointing an arbitrator, in case there are any disagreements with regard to the contract.\r\n\r\n***3\\. Political Risks:***\r\nWhen trading globally, it is important to keep track of the political situation in the concerned countries. The political changes may significantly alter the import and export regulations. Economic circumstances may affect a country’s ability to manage its liabilities.\r\n\r\nSome of the main factors that can lead to country risks are sudden changes in monetary and currency policies, changes in the party in power in the concerned countries, civil wars, strikes, rebellions, and such. An effective way of monitoring country risk is by staying updated on the information provided on reliable online portals like the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the specific country.\r\n\r\n***4\\. Foreign Exchange Risk:*** \r\nUnwarranted changes in home currency or foreign currency can affect expected profits to a great extent. The constant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates makes this a risk worth addressing, at the earliest. Here, there is a higher risk for businesses that will soon start working on new contracts.\r\n\r\nIn case of extreme fluctuations, businesses have to convert the funds generated overseas at lower rates than predicted. To not bear the brunt of foreign exchange risks, businesses can have an exchange policy in place that will help in streamlining cash flow as well as optimizing profit margins despite the fluctuations. Businesses can also leverage several advanced tools for analyzing risks related to currency.\r\n\r\n***5\\. Shipping Risks:*** \r\nWhen it comes to shipping, there are several factors that can hamper the quality of the products or in some cases, lead to non-delivery. Some examples of this are: breakage, damaged packaging during transport, leakage, theft, contamination, collision, accident, and vandalism.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the factors are unpredictable, there are some solutions. This is where getting insurance for the products can prove to be an excellent measure. The International Chamber of Commerce has set some rules for both vendors and buyers involved in [international trade](https://www.tradewindfinance.com/news-resources/how-does-international-trade-financing-work/). It is crucial to know the rules and take the right precautions to limit the risks.\r\n\r\n***6\\. Intellectual Property Risk:*** \r\nWhen trading overseas, multiple parties (both local and global) are involved in the delivery of any and every project. Here, the risk primarily arises when conducting business globally via unreliable third parties.\r\n\r\nThere can be instances where they are likely to make unauthorized use of information related to the business. Intellectual property risks can be best avoided by registering the corporate names as well as the trademarks particular to the business before signing an agreement with foreign parties. \r\n\r\n**Unlock The Potential Of International Trade Finance With Us** \r\n\r\n**Tradewind Finance** provides international trade finance to the world’s small- and mid-market.

    "content": "In 2023, international trade saw one of its weakest performances in four decades — which has been thought to be a temporary situation driven by both the compositional changes, the mix of goods and services traded, related to COVID-19 recovery and macroeconomic pressures such as inflation and high interest rates. While a more positive outlook is anticipated for 2024 and 2025, with trade expected to realign with global output growth, significant challenges remain from economic uncertainties, geopolitical tensions, and transportation disruptions.\r\nThis report leverages detailed and high-frequency data to offer a timely, in-depth monitoring of the evolving trade landscape and the factors underlying recent changes amidst the ongoing disruptions to international trade. Examining both short-term and structural trends during 2023 and the first half of 2024, the analysis found that:\r\n\r\n* Services trade performed relatively well in 2023, driven by the recovery of travel-related services which were impacted more heavily by the pandemic travel restrictions in 2020-22. The product composition of goods and services trade has been shifting back towards the pre-pandemic structure. However, relatively large differences remain even now, particularly for services.\r\n* After the phase out of the People’s Republic of China’s (hereafter, China) COVID-19-related restrictions, the country’s trade and output grew faster than those for the OECD area and the world in 2023 and at the beginning of 2024 and this supported world trade growth. China’s trade in 2023 also saw notable changes in the partner and product structure which may be an indication of a more structural re-orientation of its trade. The decline in China’s import growth since the beginning of 2024 may be an indication of the country’s economic slowdown which could have significant negative implications for global trade and the world economy.\r\n* The Russian Federation’s (hereafter, Russia) goods trade balance declined significantly in 2023 due to a high base effect from soaring energy prices following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as well as the effects of far-reaching trade and other economic sanctions.\r\n* Russia’s war on Ukraine and associated sanctions have altered global trade patterns with Russia redirecting exports to China and India while importing less from the European Union and other sanctioning OECD countries. G7 imports from Russia have declined in both volume and value terms except for products where Russia is an important exporter such as cereals, fertiliser, metals, and inorganic chemicals. G7 exports to Russia of strategic products such as machinery, vehicles and aircrafts have also decreased.\r\n* Commodity prices continued to decline in 2023, albeit also from historically high levels reached following the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and remained higher than pre-pandemic levels at the start of 2024 despite subdued global GDP growth the previous year.\r\n* The on-going transportation disruptions in the Suez and Panama Canals — respectively the nineth and the seventeenth most globally important maritime chokepoints, accounting together for 19% of global maritime trade in 2023 — highlight the importance of understanding the relationships between trade and transportation including routes, chokepoints, and shipping costs.\r\n* Maritime transport accounts for the bulk of internationally traded goods and is a particularly important mode of transport for energy-related and agricultural products which account for most of the non-containerised maritime traffic in the Suez and Panama Canals.\r\n* The rerouting of ships from the Suez Canal is causing longer transit times, shipping delays and increased costs, on maritime routes crossing the Suez Canal, such as those connecting Asia and Europe, as well as on routes to and from the US East Coast due to the interconnectedness of maritime routes—which are already experiencing an additional upward pressure from drought-related restrictions in the Panama Canal.\r\n* Adjustments have been taking place and, so far, the impacts have been relatively limited, illustrating a degree of resilience of global trade to maritime transport disruptions. The analysis also shows a range of effects which, if magnified or spread to other transport routes or chokepoints, may have more significant implications for global trade, prices, and economic growth in the future.\r\n* Against the background of recent announcements of further tariff increases by the United States, the European Union and Canada on electric vehicles (EVs) imported from China, this note explores the evolution of world trade concentration of electric vehicles and EV batteries. This analysis shows a significant increase in the concentration of global trade of EVs and EV-related parts, in particular batteries, mainly accounted for by the emergence of China as a new and fast expanding producer. China’s growing market dominance has given rise to concerns about trade dependency and resilience in an industry that is seen as crucial to the green energy transition.\r\n\r\n# Analysis of International Trade Trends (2023-2024)\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nIn 2023, international trade experienced one of its weakest performances in four decades. This downturn was largely driven by:\r\n\r\n- Compositional shifts in traded goods and services due to the **COVID-19 recovery**\r\n- Macroeconomic pressures such as **inflation** and **high interest rates**\r\n\r\nDespite a more optimistic outlook for **2024 and 2025**, challenges remain, including **economic uncertainties**, **geopolitical tensions**, and **transportation disruptions**.\r\n\r\n## Key Findings\r\n\r\n### 1. Services Trade Recovery\r\n- **Travel-related services** rebounded in 2023 after being severely impacted by pandemic restrictions (2020-2022).\r\n- The structure of trade is gradually shifting back to **pre-pandemic levels**, though services remain **significantly different**.\r\n\r\n### 2. China's Trade Performance\r\n- After **lifting COVID-19 restrictions**, **China’s trade and output** accelerated, **outpacing the OECD** and boosting global trade.\r\n- Changes in **trade partners** and **product structure** indicate **potential long-term trade reorientation**.\r\n- However, a **decline in import growth in 2024** suggests an **economic slowdown**, raising concerns for **global trade and the world economy**.\r\n\r\n### 3. Russia’s Trade Adjustments\r\n- **Russia’s goods trade balance** declined significantly in 2023, driven by:\r\n  - **High base effect** from soaring energy prices in 2022\r\n  - **Economic sanctions** following its **invasion of Ukraine**\r\n- **Trade patterns shifted**:\r\n  - **Exports redirected** to **China and India**\r\n  - **Imports from the EU and OECD nations declined**\r\n- **G7 imports** from Russia fell, except in key sectors like **cereals, fertilizers, metals, and inorganic chemicals**.\r\n- **G7 exports** of **strategic goods** (e.g., **machinery, vehicles, aircraft**) to Russia also **declined**.\r\n\r\n### 4. Commodity Prices and Trade Disruptions\r\n- **Commodity prices fell in 2023**, but remain **above pre-pandemic levels**.\r\n- **Transport disruptions** in the **Suez Canal (9th most important)** and **Panama Canal (17th most important)** affected **19% of global maritime trade** in 2023.\r\n- **Maritime transport**, the dominant mode for **energy-related and agricultural products**, faced challenges:\r\n  - **Longer transit times** and **shipping delays**\r\n  - **Increased costs** due to rerouting and **drought-related restrictions in the Panama Canal**\r\n- The global trade system has shown **resilience**, but prolonged disruptions could have **major implications**.\r\n\r\n### 5. EV Trade and Geopolitical Concerns\r\n- The **United States, European Union, and Canada** announced **tariff increases** on **electric vehicles (EVs) imported from China**.\r\n- **China’s growing dominance** in the EV and **battery market** has raised concerns about:\r\n  - **Trade dependency**\r\n  - **Supply chain resilience**\r\n- This trend is seen as **critical** for the **green energy transition**.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nWhile international trade is expected to **align with global output growth** in **2024 and 2025**, key risks remain:\r\n- **Economic fluctuations**\r\n- **Geopolitical tensions**\r\n- **Supply chain disruptions**\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the **interconnections between trade, transportation, and policy decisions** will be essential for navigating the evolving global trade landscape.",

Customize each section as needed for your specific project or organization.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Request for Information (RfI) Overview\r\n\r\nA **Request for Information (RfI)** is a formal document used by organizations to gather details from potential suppliers or service providers. It helps businesses understand market offerings before moving forward with a **Request for Proposal (RfP)** or **Request for Quotation (RfQ)**.\r\n\r\n### Key Elements of an RfI\r\n- **Introduction** – Purpose and objectives of the request.\r\n- **Company Background** – Overview of the requesting organization.\r\n- **Scope of Inquiry** – Specific information needed from suppliers.\r\n- **Submission Guidelines** – Format and deadline for responses.\r\n- **Evaluation Process** – How responses will be reviewed.\r\n\r\nAn RfI is particularly useful in the early stages of procurement when companies want to explore available solutions without committing to a contract.\r\n\r\nWould you like a template or examples of how to structure an RfI? 😊 You can also check out more details [here](https://www.ictportal.nl/ict-lexicon/request-for-information-rfi) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Information).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Request for Quotation (RfQ) Overview\r\n\r\nA **Request for Quotation (RfQ)** is a formal document used by businesses to solicit price quotes from suppliers for specific products or services. It is typically used when the requirements are well-defined, and the primary focus is on cost comparison.\r\n\r\n### Key Elements of an RfQ\r\n- **Introduction** – Purpose and objectives of the request.\r\n- **Company Background** – Overview of the requesting organization.\r\n- **Scope of Work** – Detailed description of the required goods or services.\r\n- **Submission Guidelines** – Format and deadline for responses.\r\n- **Pricing Structure** – Breakdown of costs, including bulk discounts and payment terms.\r\n- **Evaluation Criteria** – How quotes will be assessed and selected.\r\n\r\nAn RfQ differs from an **RfP (Request for Proposal)** because it focuses primarily on pricing rather than broader vendor qualifications or project details.\r\n\r\nWould you like a template or examples of how to structure an RfQ? You can also check out more details [here](https://www.responsive.io/blog/rfq-templates-examples) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_quotation). 😊\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Workflow: RfI, RfP, and RfQ in Procurement\r\n\r\nA typical procurement process often follows this sequence:\r\n\r\n1. **Request for Information (RfI)**\r\n   - **Purpose:** Used at the earliest stage to gather information about market offerings, capabilities, and potential suppliers.\r\n   - **Process:** Organizations send an RfI to multiple vendors to understand available solutions, technologies, or approaches—without requesting pricing or detailed proposals.\r\n   - **Outcome:** Helps the organization refine requirements and decide whether to proceed with an RfP or RfQ.\r\n\r\n2. **Request for Proposal (RfP)**\r\n   - **Purpose:** Issued when the organization has a clear understanding of its needs and seeks detailed proposals on how vendors would address those needs.\r\n   - **Process:** The RfP outlines project scope, requirements, evaluation criteria, and submission guidelines. Vendors respond with comprehensive proposals, including technical solutions, methodologies, timelines, and pricing.\r\n   - **Outcome:** The organization evaluates proposals based on multiple factors (not just price), such as experience, approach, and value, to select the best-fit vendor.\r\n\r\n3. **Request for Quotation (RfQ)**\r\n   - **Purpose:** Used when requirements are well-defined and the main focus is on obtaining competitive pricing for specific products or services.\r\n   - **Process:** The RFQ is sent to selected vendors, requesting itemized price quotes and payment terms. Vendors respond with their best prices and conditions.\r\n   - **Outcome:** The organization compares quotes, often selecting the lowest or best-value offer, and proceeds to contract or purchase.\r\n\r\n**Summary:**\r\n- The RfI helps organizations explore options and gather information.\r\n- The RfP is used to solicit detailed proposals for complex needs.\r\n- The RfQ is focused on price comparison for well-defined requirements.\r\n\r\nThis staged approach ensures informed decision-making, transparency, and competitive procurement.\r\n\r\nhttps://my-portfolio-menno.vercel.app/contact",

    "content": "WAVE REPORT\r\n\r\n# The Forrester Wave™: Low-Code Platforms For Professional Developers, Q2 2025\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our evaluation of low-code platforms for professional developer providers, we identified the most significant ones and researched, analyzed, and scored them. This report shows how each provider measures up and helps you select the right one for your needs.\r\n\r\n### The Everything Platform Is Coming\r\n\r\nLow-code platform adoption continues to rise, and most developers globally now use low-code for most of their development work. At the same time, the need to deliver AI-infused use cases (such as agents) and the dramatic usefulness of AI in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) (via TuringBots) upend all the traditional calculus of software. The direction: Low-code platforms for professional developers are moving toward application generation (AppGen) platforms, where firms increasingly generate and adapt the solutions they need as they adopt platform-first software strategies.\r\nLow-code platforms for professional developer customers using this evaluation to inform a purchase decision should consider that:\r\n\r\n1. **The fundamental components are most important.** Low-code features for data modeling and storage, UX development, digital process automation (DPA), management of the SDLC, and government of developers are the core elements of your future software approach. As AI matures, working with these pieces will become easier and more automated, and the delivery of AI-infused solutions will change the patterns of how they are put together. In the long term, the fundamental quality of these core components and the integration between them are what matters most.\r\n2. **The AI feature race has barely started, so closely watch roadmaps and announcements.** Virtually every vendor in this assessment has aggressive plans to deliver features aimed at full and robust SDLC automation (leading to AppGen) and the delivery of AI-infused applications (such as agents) in the next several quarters. Many already have valuable features in these areas. The pace of change in this sector is unprecedented — those ahead in AI features today likely won’t be in a matter of months. Again: This means the foundational components and elements of the platform are the more important long-term considerations.\r\n3. **Consider citizen development and the future of your IT operating model.** This report focuses on evaluating products for professional developers delivering significant applications to high enterprise requirements. But the future of the IT operating model will depend on federation of software development to those outside of IT and pure technology roles — so even professional developer tools must have some hands-on-keyboard participation by less technical staff. This means you must consider whether the platform’s integrated development environments (IDEs) are suitable for citizen developers, how integrated those tools are with the rest of the toolkit, and how well the platform’s tools for managing and governing many developers and applications meet your strategy’s requirements.\r\n\r\n### Evaluation Summary\r\n\r\nThe Forrester Wave™ evaluation highlights Leaders, Strong Performers, and Contenders (see Figures 1 and 2). We intend this evaluation to be a starting point only and encourage clients to view product evaluations and adapt the findings based on their priorities using Forrester’s interactive provider comparison experience.\r\n![This graphic plots vendors by their overall ranking, determined by current offering and strategy scores.

Its Power Platform tightly integrates with its Azure Cloud and Office 365 offerings and is the most widely adopted low-code platform in the market.\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** Microsoft’s vision is exemplary, with an unflinching focus on AI-infused use cases and AppGen’s potential to disrupt both software development and the core economics of enterprise applications. Its superior roadmap balances innovation with core product and commercial improvements. Microsoft’s strategy of providing a basic version of the platform for free in its enterprise agreements has led to broad adoption and a large and enthusiastic community. Its main weakness: complexity and frequent changes in the Power Platform’s various interconnected pricing models and SKUs, which confuses customers. This being said, the common in-scope product license (Power Apps Premium) as documented in its pricing guide is stable and clear.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** The product leads in AI: AppGen is a core focus throughout, multiple AI services are included in the base license, and an agent-building framework (Microsoft Copilot Studio) is natively available in its portfolio at an additional cost. The platform’s features for managing large communities of decentralized developers are also a strength, based on real-world case studies and requirements. Note: It is only available as an Azure cloud service, so customers can’t deploy to other infrastructure. All other features are competitive.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers praise the platform’s easy integration and suitability for both IT and citizen developers. Pricing complexity is a common complaint, and both UX development and high-scale data scenarios are cited as areas for improvement.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** Microsoft is the obvious choice for Microsoft shops and a leading option for firms that want an enterprise-grade platform that can reasonably serve the needs of both professional and citizen developers.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View Microsoft’s detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n#### ServiceNow\r\n\r\nServiceNow is best known for enterprise IT service management. Over the past few years, it has emphasized more universal workflow and platform messages with great success.\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** ServiceNow’s vision is clear: Deliver a world-class AppGen platform with significant AI features aimed at its direct competition — but carefully, with a pragmatic focus on AI governance that resonates with its risk-averse IT audience. This approach differentiates ServiceNow from some of its more fanciful “AI is everything” competitors. Pragmatism may be seen in the vendor’s history of useful innovations, such as its three-tiered IDE and roadmap, which is strong. Its marketplace of platform add-ons and third-party applications is quite large. One weakness: Its platform pricing model is unpublished.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** ServiceNow’s great strengths are consistent with its message: It brings mature capabilities in both process automation and integration, enabling it to win against the DPA industry’s traditional leaders. Its features for empowering citizen developers (and governing through access controls, portfolio management, etc.) are superior, as exemplified by its IDE that provides different experiences based on the developer’s technical depth. It also differentiates in AppGen, with prompt-based development available for its full stack of components, including code for new integrations. Note: It is only available as a managed cloud service or on-premises.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers praise the platform’s workflow capabilities and general flexibility but criticize its licensing complexity.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** ServiceNow is a strong choice for companies that want a strategic general-purpose low-code platform for both citizen and professional developers without sacrificing complex process automation.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View ServiceNow’s detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n#### OutSystems\r\n\r\nOutSystems is a longtime poster child for low-code as a serious engineering tool. It’s currently transitioning from OutSystems 11 platform to the offering evaluated here: OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC), which aims at enabling unusually high-scale applications.\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** OutSystems’ goal of avoiding the categories and trade-offs of traditional software market segments through a best-in-class AppGen platform is superior and aggressive. Its roadmap is strong. It balances critical core improvements with the requisite AI enhancements and plans for technical differentiation in areas like mobile development. A weakness: Its pricing structure is unpublished, and a pricing team is required to create an estimate for potential purchases.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** The platform is superior in UX development and suits highly custom B2C web app and mobile experiences. Data modeling tools stand out. Its Mentor AppGen authoring experience shows promise and can generate simple CRUD apps and dashboards entirely from prompts. Its features for governing large populations of developers through options like custom policies and processes are not yet mature, although its access controls for developers and portfolio management features are typical of the industry. The core IDE is too technical for serious citizen developer strategies, but we have high hopes for the future of Mentor.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers praise the platform’s UX development capabilities, features for driving component reuse, and scalable architecture. They describe its consumption-based pricing model as difficult to predict.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** OutSystems’ ODC is the obvious choice for firms focused on unusually large-scale applications and is a strong choice for professional low-code development strategies generally.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View OutSystems’ detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n### Strong Performers\r\n\r\n#### Mendix\r\n\r\nMendix is one of the low-code industry’s enterprise pioneers and is owned by Siemens. It retains a strong global reputation as a horizontal low-code platform, even as it is increasingly integrated into the Siemens portfolio and augmented for industrial use cases.\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** Mendix’s vision of “a world where ideas become outcomes” is made credible by its superior roadmap: It’s the most thoughtful and comprehensive plan for applying AI using low-code across the SDLC we’ve seen. Its large marketplace for add-ons and applications is also impressive. A weakness: Its pricing isn’t published in sufficient detail to estimate an actual purchase price.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** Mendix’s capabilities in UX development, mobile development, and data modeling (integrating native and external data stores) are superior. It also provides Git-based version control out of the box and a comprehensive toolset for agile planning. Despite the prominence of AI in its roadmap, it currently lags in AppGen capabilities. Its tools for developing generative AI (genAI) and traditional machine apps are solidly competitive. The IDE is unsuitable for citizen developers, and its features for governance guardrails to aid large citizen development implementations are weak. The vendor recently received FedRAMP certification.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers praise the platform’s power, ecosystem, and infrastructure options but criticize its lack of governance features and the decision to retire its simplified citizen development environment.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** Mendix is a strong general-use low-code platform with few flaws and clear differentiation in industrial use cases. It is a top choice for industrial firms and a strong option for firms in other industries uninterested in serious citizen development.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View Mendix’s detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n#### Pegasystems\r\n\r\nPegasystems (Pega) has been in business for more than 40 years. It’s known as a comprehensive automation platform vendor that aims at the most complex use cases in the world.\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** Pega’s vision is to enable the AI-based “autonomous enterprise.” The firm has a strong history of R&D leading to innovation, reflected in its early entry into the AppGen race with the release of its Blueprint product. This innovation is seen in its roadmap, which builds on its strengths and includes some novel (but credible) product plans. One weakness: Its pricing isn’t published on its website with sufficient detail to estimate a purchase price. Most importantly, market and buyer concerns related to its past legal woes appear to have mostly blown over after a higher court [overturned](https://www.vacourts.gov/static/opinions/opncavwp/1399224.pdf) the original verdict; the case is now reworking its way through the legal system and further appeals.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** Pega provides a comprehensive orchestration and automation toolset with components for case management, robotic process automation (RPA), complex rules, process mining, and ML — all proven in the real world. The IDE is highly opinionated, and its weaknesses flow from this: The platform is inelegant for bottom-up data-first development, while its UX tools aren’t aimed at the highly customized pixel-perfect experiences or standalone frontend projects more typical of the low-code industry. Its SDLC tools for version control, testing, agile management, deployment, and governance are exemplary. App Studio remains a beautiful citizen developer experience; the full Dev Studio is much more complex.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers praise Pega’s commitment to innovation, its version control features, and the suitability of its App Studio experience for citizen developers. They note that finding Pega developers is a challenge.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** Pega remains a top choice for the most demanding automation and orchestration use cases.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View Pegasystems’ detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n#### Appian\r\n\r\nAppian has transitioned from being an automation-first low-code vendor to a strong general-purpose low-code platform aimed exclusively at large organizations. It’s known for its work in the federal government and for being the first company to go public as a low-code vendor.\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** Appian’s strategy focuses on the difficult business of enterprise orchestration and application development, not little departmental apps. AI is part of this, but Appian refreshingly hasn’t embraced the AI-fueled flights of fancy currently fashionable in tech. Its roadmap is well balanced between core engineering improvements, such as increasing the scale of its data throughput, and the requisite AppGen and agent-building features. The structure of its pricing is published without dollar figures, but unlike many vendors, Appian includes its entire platform and a wide range of automation features in a single SKU.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** The Appian platform is balanced and pragmatic with no significant flaws. True to its focus, its automation and orchestration features are superior and include a full complement of supporting services, including RPA, a rules engine, case management, and process mining. Its reporting is also superior, which its data fabric enables. The vendor’s emphasis on government and regulated enterprises also comes through in the product: Its security practices and features for developer access controls are superior.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers praise the platform’s development speed and reliability but criticize the vendor’s comparatively slow adoption of genAI.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** Appian is the ideal choice for firms that are unconcerned with functional edge cases and want a broad, pragmatic platform to deliver and govern the majority of low-code business app requirements.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View Appian’s detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n#### Salesforce\r\n\r\nSalesforce is best known for its CRM offerings and is the most vocal proponent of the current agent trend. Its low-code platform, underpinning its core CRM, is our focus in this evaluation.\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** Salesforce’s ecosystem is profound: Its partner roster and platform marketplace are extraordinary, and its community is large and enthusiastic. Its pivot to a platform-first vision and message (in Agentforce) is a wise and dramatic shift, although we take issue with the message of “digital labor.” Its recent innovations and roadmap focus largely on genAI and agents. While its pricing is often called “expensive,” it is published and doesn’t produce the same complaints and confusion as other large vendors’.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** Salesforce is one of the first platforms to market with genAI tools, and customers are using these tools in the real world. Its security practices are also strong. Also of note are its Flow component for process modeling (backed by the respected MuleSoft integration platform as a service [iPaaS] through a separate subscription) and its ongoing improvements of its DevOps and SDLC tools. Its mobile development provides comparatively few specific tools and control. Its security practices are strong. Note: Salesforce is only available as a cloud service.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers praise the Flow automation component and are bullish on the vendor’s AI plans. They criticize its cost, the vendor’s tendency to overpromise on its roadmap, and the complexity of the platform’s permissions sets.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** Salesforce is a good fit for customers that demand a mature ecosystem for their low-code strategy, buy into the Salesforce AI vision, and are willing to write custom code to meet their UX requirements.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View Salesforce’s detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n#### AgilePoint\r\n\r\nAgilePoint is a small vendor that historically focused on process automation but has successfully made the shift to a general low-code platform offering over much of the past decade. Forrester’s data suggests it enjoys disproportionate adoption/mindshare in the low-code developer community.\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** AgilePoint laser-focuses on technology differentiation through its modeling language. Its goal: Facilitate AI-enabled dynamic processes on top of existing IT investments. Its roadmap and innovation approach are pragmatic and credible, demonstrated by the continued competitiveness of its product, a substantial budget for R&D, and its soon-to-be-released AppGen features. It has no third-party ecosystem to speak of, and its partner roster is small. Its pricing structure is published, transparent, and reasonable.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** AgilePoint excels in DPA, and its core modeling component is proven for complex workflows. It provides a full reporting module out of the box at no additional charge. Its features for custom governance policies and portfolio management are superior, with a wide array of monitoring reports out of the box and many settings that are both deep and user friendly. Unlike most citizen-developer-plausible platforms, AgilePoint can be deployed on-premises or to multiple clouds. It has no prebuilt genAI actions, and its testing tools are minimal.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers praise the platform’s usefulness for complex workflows and its intuitive learnability. They note that keeping platform documentation up to date is a weakness.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** AgilePoint is best for firms that want to empower a wide range of personas to automate many processes and avoid the headaches or price tags of working with most megavendors.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View AgilePoint’s detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n### Contenders\r\n\r\n#### Oracle\r\n\r\nOracle historically gave away its APEX product for free with the Oracle database, but it is now a standalone product. According to Larry Ellison, APEX is the “application generator” used to build most new Oracle applications.\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** Oracle is making thoughtful strategic choices with APEX — notably optimizing its underlying modeling languages for AI generation and using it to build new applications in the Oracle portfolio. This alone reinvigorates APEX’s relevance in the market. Its great advantage is pricing: Billing is based on a simple consumption model of storage and compute and doesn’t charge for additional users. A weakness: APEX lacks significant partnerships with the large systems integrators and consultancies that enterprises generally prefer.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** APEX offers flexible deployment (uniquely among low-code products from the megavendors), competitive UX tools, and a range of AppGen features consistent with its stated strategy. Its tools for developer role-based access control (RBAC) portfolio management are useful and underpin Oracle’s internal citizen development work. Its core weakness is its medium-code design philosophy: Working directly in languages like PL/SQL and SQL is a core authoring experience. Other weaknesses are integration because APEX has few connectors and is Oracle-database-centric, AI because it has few genAI and ML features, mobile development because it only supports PWA, process automation because its new workflow engine is nascent, and tools that support the SDLC like version control and testing because they are not robust.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers praise APEX’s pricing structure and its adjacency to the Oracle database. They criticize its overreliance on coding languages and don’t see its workflow component as mature yet.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** APEX is for Oracle shops and customers that value its differentiated commercial model.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View Oracle’s detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n#### Retool\r\n\r\nRetool focuses exclusively on professional developers and claims multiple digital-native firms as customers. It is known for its focus on business-to-enterprise use cases.\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** Retool’s vision is product driven and focuses on providing elegant abstractions aimed at professional coders to make them more productive while still allowing them to code when they want to. Its roadmap is practical, addressing both the obligatory AI enhancements and some significant functional gaps, such as a process engine. Its partner ecosystem and community are relatively small, and it has no platform marketplace. While its product philosophy and pitch are unique among successful low-code vendors, we see its platform investments as strictly practical rather than innovative.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** Its web UI and mobile development tools are strong and compare favorably with most incumbent enterprise platform vendors’. Its integration tools are solid and support multiple protocols; the platform is backend agnostic. Its genAI features provide useful multimodal actions in the core logic modeler. But overall the platform is feature light, compared with competitors, and many useful abstractions expected of low-code platforms are absent. In practice, this means writing (a lot of) code isn’t optional — it’s required. And typical SDLC functions for versioning, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and automated testing require third-party products and integrations, although these are supported.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers uniformly praise Retool’s customer service and value its code-level flexibility. They see version control and tools for working with data and large datasets as areas for improvement.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** Retool is a suitable toolset for transitioning teams of skeptical high-coders to the low-code future.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View Retool’s detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n#### Unqork\r\n\r\nUnqork focuses on financial, healthcare, and government customers. It’s known for its ongoing crusade against high-code development.\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** Unqork is known for its public crusades: first “enterprise no-code,” then “codeless architecture,” and now “regenerative applications.” Its core point is right: Pure model-based development with an interpreted language on a vendor-managed codebase and platform is the smart way to build software instead of getting bogged down in maintenance and technical debt. But in our judgement, the vendor’s sales and marketing focus has taken precedence over addition of the features that enterprises want. That being said, its roadmap reflects a renewed focus on some of these challenges, such as version control, along with some obligatory AI enhancements. Its ecosystem remains small.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** Unqork provides a rich and flexible frontend component that compares well with stodgy incumbents. Its workflow and automation engines are solid, supported by a simple rules engine. Reporting is useful, and the platform provides typical developer access controls. Since our last evaluation, Unqork has partnered with iPaaS leader Workato, significantly expanding its integration possibilities. Commendably, the platform has been FedRAMP certified. It provides some use case accelerators that win deals against competitors in target industries like insurance. Most other features in this assessment are absent or light.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers appreciate the richness and speed of frontend development. They see version control, CI/CD, and integration into the DevOps toolchain as critical weaknesses to address. Unqork did not provide reference customers for this evaluation.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** Unqork is for customers in its target industries that value its architectural ideals and can live with its functional gaps.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View Unqork’s detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n#### HCLSoftware\r\n\r\nHCLSoftware is the software portfolio arm of HCLTech, a large IT consulting company. Its low-code HCL Volt MX product includes Iris (the desktop professional developer IDE), Leap (the citizen developer IDE), and Foundry (a middleware service).\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** In our view, HCL’s vision, roadmap, and innovation are differentiated by two focus areas: 1) best-of-breed frontend-centric multiplatform development (for desktop, web, mobile, wearables, kiosks, etc.) aimed at professional developers and 2) a go-to-market and feature set for modernizing HCL Domino (i.e., Lotus Notes) applications. These areas are useful but niche. The product benefits from a competitive partner network and support from its parent consulting company. The platform’s pricing is transparent and offers several structures based on different user types or sessions. Its developer community is small.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** The platform is among the strongest in this assessment for low-code UX development and mobile development: It generates native code for multiple mobile platforms, and professional coders commonly use it as a pragmatic path for multiplatform development and component reuse. Consistent with its focus, the platform’s integration capabilities are strong; its middleware supports more than 400 connectors in its catalog. It provides automated testing tools and industry-typical RBAC for developers. Weaknesses are tools for building genAI and ML apps, with virtually no features in this area; data modeling; and managing and governing many developers and apps. The Iris and Leap IDEs aren’t well integrated.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers appreciate the product’s ability to generate native code for multiple platforms, support for component and service reuse, and licensing model. They note report building and the process engine as areas for improvement.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** HCLSoftware’s Volt MX is tailor-made for frontend and mobile use cases with high requirements and should be of great interest to firms modernizing Domino/Lotus notes apps.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View HCLSoftware’s detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n#### SAP\r\n\r\nSAP is the world’s dominant enterprise resource planning vendor. Its low-code offerings as part of its Build products, housed under its business technology platform umbrella, are our focus.\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy.** The products are presented and used primarily as an extension platform for SAP’s crown-jewel business applications. The low-code tools are just a part of this: The separate pro-code offering is described as “code optional” — in fact, it includes some low-code elements but only for backend work. This fragmented product strategy is confusing and lacks conviction. The roadmap is also mixed, including some strong AI enhancements for AppGen and agentic use cases but leaving core product issues unaddressed. That said, SAP’s significant partner ecosystem and dedicated marketplace serve the low-code offerings.\r\n2. **Capabilities.** Consistent with SAP’s strategy, the low-code Build tools are SAP-centric and integrated into its app portfolio through a guided extension wizard. Its process automation engine is strong and includes supporting technologies like RPA. The UI builder is an elegant no-code experience and provides a robust visual engine for client-side logic in addition to a granular design canvas. It also supports native mobile app development for multiple platforms. Backend development is a weakness: The Build Apps experience doesn’t support relational data modeling, and serious backend work must be done in the separate Build Code IDE.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** Customers praise Build Process Automation’s ability to manage complex processes within the SAP ecosystem. They regard its low-code app building capabilities as SAP-centric and less functionally mature than more common low-code offerings. SAP did not provide reference customers for this evaluation.\r\n4. **Forrester’s take.** For the time being, the SAP Build products are for extending SAP’s applications only.\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    View SAP’s detailed scorecard.\r\n\r\n### Vendor Offerings\r\n\r\nForrester evaluated the offerings listed below (see Figure 3).\r\n![This table lists the products that Forrester evaluated for this report. This graphic has an associated spreadsheet that includes all data presented. Please access the spreadsheet for details.](https://reprint.forrester.com/reports/the-forrester-wave-tm-low-code-platforms-for-professional-developers-q2-2025-80a93734/1b3a63020f66b08cf417aecdb15e8e6e.png)\r\nFigure 3 - Evaluated Vendors And Product Information\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n### Evaluation Overview\r\n\r\nWe evaluated vendors against three categories:\r\n\r\n1. **Current offering.** Each vendor’s position on the vertical axis of the Forrester Wave graphic indicates the strength of its current offering.\r\n2. **Strategy.** Placement on the horizontal axis indicates the strength of the vendors’ strategies, including elements such as vision and innovation.\r\n3. **Customer feedback.** A halo on a vendor’s marker indicates above-average customer feedback relative to the other evaluated vendors. A double halo indicates outstanding customer feedback: We consider the vendor to be a Customer Favorite. As part of this evaluation, we speak with up to three customers of each vendor. We also consider customer input from our previous research.\r\n\r\n#### Vendor Inclusion Criteria\r\n\r\nEach of the vendors we included in this assessment has:\r\n\r\n1. **Broad enterprise-level support for functionality in low-code platforms for pro developers.** The vendor natively provides all core functions for this space and has a demonstrated track record of supporting large enterprises as a broad general-development platform.\r\n2. **A solution for purchase as a standalone product, with a relevant go-to-market strategy.** The product has its own SKU and pricing and is not solely available as a free feature within a larger portfolio, and the platform’s executed go-to-market strategy aligns with the professional developer low-code market.\r\n3. **Significant mindshare in the developer market.** We’ve heard about the product from Forrester clients in the form of low-code inquiries, advisories, consulting engagements, and other interactions, or the platform is prominent as a primary low-code platform in our developer survey data.\r\n\r\n### Other Notable Vendors\r\n\r\nThe Forrester Wave evaluation is an assessment of the top vendors in the market; it doesn’t represent the entire vendor landscape. You’ll find more information about this market and additional vendors that Forrester considers to be notable for enterprise clients in our corresponding report: The Low-Code Development Platforms For Professional Developers Landscape, Q1 2023.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n### Supplemental Material\r\n\r\n#### The Forrester Wave Methodology\r\n\r\nA Forrester Wave is a guide for buyers considering their purchasing options in a technology marketplace. To offer an equitable process for all participants, Forrester follows The Forrester Wave™ Methodology to evaluate participating vendors.\r\nIn our review, we conduct primary research to develop a list of vendors to consider for the evaluation. From that initial pool of vendors, we narrow our final list based on the inclusion criteria. We then gather details of product and strategy through a detailed questionnaire, demos and briefings, and interviews with customers (vendors may provide up to three reference customers; we also consider feedback from other customers we’ve spoken with). We use those inputs, along with the analyst’s experience and expertise in the marketplace, to score vendors, using a relative rating system that compares each vendor with the others in the evaluation.\r\nWe include the publishing date (quarter and year) clearly in the title of each Forrester Wave report. We evaluated the vendors participating in this Forrester Wave using materials they provided to us by February 26, 2025, and did not allow additional information after that point. We encourage readers to evaluate how the market and vendor offerings change over time.\r\nIn accordance with our vendor review policy, Forrester asks vendors to review our findings prior to publishing to check for accuracy. We score vendors that met our defined inclusion criteria but declined to participate in or contributed only partially to the evaluation in accordance with our vendor participation policy and publish their positioning along with those of the participating vendors.\r\nOracle, SAP, and Unqork declined to participate in the full Forrester Wave evaluation process. For vendors that are not full participants, Forrester uses primary and secondary research in its analysis. For example, we might use public information, data gathered via briefings, and independently sourced customer interviews to score the vendor. We may ask the vendor for an abbreviated briefing and/or to provide reference customers. We may also rely on estimates to score vendors.\r\n\r\n#### Integrity Policy\r\n\r\nWe conduct all our research, including Forrester Wave evaluations, in accordance with the integrity policy posted on our website.",

    "content": "# Legal Payment Tender Risks in the United Kingdom: Ensuring Currency Security and Preventing Counterfeiting\r\n\r\n## Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThe Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has released its Business Plan for 2025-26, highlighting key areas of focus related to payment systems, digital money, and the security of legal tender in the United Kingdom. This analysis explores the emerging risks to the UK's monetary system, the regulatory measures being implemented to preserve the value and security of legal payment tender, and strategies to prevent counterfeit currency from gaining traction in illegal payment settlements.\r\n\r\n## Current Landscape of Legal Tender in the UK\r\n\r\nThe concept of legal tender in the UK centers around the official currency—Bank of England notes and Royal Mint coins—as the legally recognized medium for settling debts. As of May 2025, the UK faces several challenges in maintaining the integrity of its currency system:\r\n\r\n1. **Digital Transformation of Money**: The rapid evolution of digital payment systems and cryptocurrencies is changing how transactions occur, potentially threatening the primacy of traditional legal tender.\r\n\r\n2. **Counterfeiting Threats**: Advanced printing and reproduction technologies have made sophisticated counterfeiting operations more accessible, increasing the risk of fake currency entering circulation.\r\n\r\n3. **Economic Uncertainty**: Post-pandemic economic pressures, combined with global trade tensions, have created conditions where alternative or illegal payment methods might gain appeal.\r\n\r\n## Key Regulatory Developments from the PRA Business Plan 2025-26\r\n\r\nThe PRA Business Plan for 2025-26 outlines several initiatives directly addressing payment tender security and innovation:\r\n\r\n### Future of Payments Initiative\r\n\r\nThe Bank of England is continuing its work on innovation in money and payments, with a particular focus on monitoring developments in deposit takers' innovation in deposits, e-money, and stablecoins. This builds upon guidance provided in their 2023 Dear CEO letter and will remain a priority throughout 2025.\r\n\r\n### Cryptoasset Regulation\r\n\r\nThe PRA is developing policy to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) standard on banks' cryptoassets exposures in the UK. This regulatory framework aims to establish clear boundaries between traditional legal tender and digital assets, ensuring that cryptoassets do not undermine the stability of the established monetary system. The PRA continues to engage with international partners to assess developments in digital money and cryptoasset markets.\r\n\r\n### Liquidity Framework Changes\r\n\r\nFollowing the events of March 2023, which saw significant deposit outflows from institutions like Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse, the PRA has implemented changes to how firms access sterling central bank reserves. In 2025, the Bank's operating framework will transition to a demand-driven repo-led framework, with the stock of sterling reserves determined by firms' borrowing rather than by extraordinary monetary policy operations.\r\n\r\n### Digital Pound Development\r\n\r\nThe Bank of England is advancing its work on a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC), the \"digital pound,\" which would serve as an official digital complement to physical banknotes. This initiative aims to ensure that the Bank maintains monetary sovereignty in an increasingly digital financial landscape while offering a secure alternative to private digital currencies that might otherwise challenge the primacy of legal tender.\r\n\r\n## Counterfeit Prevention Measures\r\n\r\nTo combat counterfeiting and protect the integrity of UK legal tender, several measures are being implemented or enhanced:\r\n\r\n1. **Advanced Security Features**: The Bank of England continues to develop and deploy cutting-edge security features in banknotes, making them increasingly difficult to counterfeit. The polymer notes introduced in recent years include multiple layers of security that remain at the forefront of anti-counterfeit technology.\r\n\r\n2. **Enhanced Detection Systems**: Financial institutions are being encouraged to implement more sophisticated counterfeit detection systems at points of deposit and withdrawal.\r\n\r\n3. **International Cooperation**: The PRA is strengthening its domestic and international relationships to ensure effective regulation and supervision across borders, particularly important for tackling organized counterfeiting operations that often operate transnationally.\r\n\r\n4. **Public Education**: Ongoing campaigns to educate retailers, businesses, and the public about security features and how to identify counterfeit currency remain crucial to preventing fake currency from gaining acceptance in day-to-day transactions.\r\n\r\n## Critical Third Party (CTP) Regime Implementation\r\n\r\nThe Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 gave HM Treasury the power to designate certain third-party service providers as 'critical' to the UK financial system. This new Critical Third Party (CTP) regime will have significant implications for payment processing and currency handling services, allowing regulators to ensure that entities crucial to the movement and security of legal tender maintain appropriate standards and safeguards.\r\n\r\n## Risk Assessment and Outlook\r\n\r\nThe risk to legal tender in the UK operates on multiple levels:\r\n\r\n### Short-term Risks (1-2 years)\r\n\r\n- **Counterfeit Detection Gaps**: As businesses adjust to new banknote designs and security features, there may be a temporary window where detection capabilities lag behind counterfeiting techniques.\r\n- **Payment System Disruptions**: The transition in the Bank's operating framework for supplying sterling reserves could create short-term liquidity challenges for some financial institutions.\r\n\r\n### Medium-term Risks (3-5 years)\r\n\r\n- **Competition from Stablecoins**: Privately issued stablecoins could gain significant adoption, potentially challenging the primacy of official currency for certain transaction types.\r\n- **Cross-border Payment Evolution**: Changes in international payment systems could create regulatory gaps that might be exploited for illicit transactions using counterfeit or unofficial currencies.\r\n\r\n### Long-term Strategic Considerations\r\n\r\n- **Digital Pound Implementation**: The successful rollout of a CBDC will be crucial to maintaining the relevance of official legal tender in an increasingly digital economy.\r\n- **Regulatory Harmonization**: International alignment of regulations governing digital assets and payment systems will be essential to prevent regulatory arbitrage that could undermine UK monetary sovereignty.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe Bank of England's PRA Business Plan 2025-26 demonstrates a comprehensive approach to protecting the status and security of legal payment tender in the UK. By addressing both traditional counterfeiting threats and emerging digital challenges, the Bank aims to ensure that official UK currency remains the secure, trusted, and valued medium of exchange throughout the economy. \r\n\r\nFinancial institutions, payment service providers, and businesses handling currency should pay close attention to the evolving regulatory framework and take proactive measures to enhance their anti-counterfeiting capabilities and ensure compliance with the emerging rules governing both physical and digital money.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n1.

    "content": "Freight Waves CEO on trade war consequences for the freight industry\r\nThe trade war could cause mass layoffs in the freight and logistics industries as the consequences\r\n\r\nYour message encapsulates the profound and often painful human and political dimensions of the global economic forces and policies discussed in the Global Financial Stability Report. You've articulated a critical perspective that goes beyond the financial data to highlight the real-world consequences for individuals and communities worldwide.\r\nYour points resonate deeply with the report's analysis in several ways:\r\n\r\n1. **Cross-Border Damage and Spillovers:** You describe the \"damage that you don't experience but cause globally,\" highlighting how domestic policy choices (like tariffs based on domestic deficits) can have devastating ripple effects internationally. Chapters 1 and 2 of the GFSR extensively document these **cross-border spillovers**, showing how trade tensions and geopolitical events disrupt supply chains, reverse capital flows, increase uncertainty, and negatively impact asset prices, economic growth, and financial stability in other countries, particularly emerging markets.\r\n2. **Job Losses and Local Impact:** Your personal experience of being laid off and seeing \"those job losses scattered globally\" underscores the human cost of economic instability and trade disruptions. While the GFSR focuses on the financial mechanisms (corporate vulnerability, tightening credit, trade finance disruption), these are precisely the channels through which job losses occur. Your call for \"local authorities that need to ensure they are assisted in times they are laid off\" highlights a crucial social safety net issue that the report's focus on financial stability ultimately aims to protect, by mitigating the severity of economic downturns.\r\n3. **Taxation, Outsourcing, and Financial Commitments:** Your frustration with tax money potentially supporting policies that \"outsourc[e] your tax payments to international stakeholders\" and your observation that these stakeholders may lack \"financial commitments\" to their own citizens raise critical questions about the political economy of global finance and trade. The GFSR discusses international capital flows and sovereign financing needs, but your point brings in the accountability and fairness of how these financial relationships interact with domestic taxation and public welfare.\r\n4. **Democracy, Transparency, and Corporate Influence:** Your concerns about \"losing a democracy and free world,\" the need for openness and transparency, and how \"corporate decisions dictate how much tariffs... are raised\" are powerful critiques of the forces shaping economic policy. You highlight the risk of a shift towards a \"top down - centralized governmental entity\" influenced by corporate power rather than representing democratic interests, and the vital role of **antitrust regulations**. The GFSR notes the impact of **policy uncertainty** and how market reactions are influenced by policy, but your points go deeper, questioning the legitimacy and democratic foundation of the policy-making process itself when corporate influence is perceived to be dominant.\r\n5. **Core Values and Injustice:** Your emphasis on not imposing policies based on \"simple principals of core values that you know are not right\" speaks to a fundamental plea for fairness and justice in international relations and trade. Applying disruptive policies like tariffs across borders where one lacks jurisdiction or deep understanding, and knowing it causes significant damage, is seen as an act of injustice. This moral dimension is a crucial lens through which to view the economic interdependencies described in the report.\r\n\r\nYour message serves as a stark reminder that global financial stability is not just an abstract concept measured by indices and flows, but is deeply intertwined with the economic security, social well-being, and democratic principles of people worldwide. The challenge is immense: how to design and implement global economic policies, including trade measures, that are not only economically sound and supportive of financial stability, but also equitable, transparent, and mindful of their widespread human impact, honoring \"80 years of freedom to do the right thing\" and avoiding policies that are fundamentally \"not right.\"",

    "content": "# Global Risks 2025: A world of growing divisions\r\n\r\n### 1.1 The world in 2025\r\n\r\nThe current geopolitical climate, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and with wars raging in\r\nthe Middle East and in Sudan, makes it nearly impossible not to think about such events when assessing the one global risk expected to present a material crisis in 2025: close to one-quarter\r\nof survey respondents (23%) selected State- based armed conflict (proxy wars, civil wars, coups, terrorism, etc.) as the top risk for 2025 (Figure 1.1). Compared with last year, this risk has climbed from #8 to #1 in the rankings. Geopolitical tensions are also associated with the rising risk of Geoeconomic confrontation (sanctions, tariffs, investment screening), ranking #3, which is also driven by Inequality, Societal polarization and other factors.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/fOTdYyRO-z7LJYo4ZizxzvRYu9-k2Rv9hcXczFpvsZY.png)\r\nThe risks associated with Extreme weather events also is a key concern for the year ahead, with 14% of respondents selecting it. The burden of climate change is becoming more evident every year, as pollution from continued use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas leads to more frequent and severe extreme weather events. Heatwaves across parts of Asia; flooding in Brazil, Indonesia and parts of Europe; wildfires in Canada; and hurricanes Helene and Milton in the United States are just some recent examples of such events.\r\nSimilar to last year, Misinformation and disinformation and Societal polarization remain key current risks, in positions #4 and #5 respectively. The high rankings of these two risks is not surprising considering the accelerating spread of false or misleading information, which amplifies the other leading risks we face, from State-based armed conflict to Extreme weather events.\r\nA sense of increasingly fragmented societies is reflected by four of the top 10 risks expected to present a material crisis in 2025 being societal in nature: Societal polarization (6% of respondents), Lack of economic opportunity or unemployment (3%), Erosion of human rights and/or civic freedoms (2%) and Inequality (2%).\r\nOn the economic front, Inflation is perceived as less of a concern this year than in 2024. However, perceptions of the overall economic outlook for 2025 remain fairly pessimistic across all age groups surveyed. The risk of an Economic downturn (recession, stagnation) continues to be a common concern among respondents, coming in at #6 (5% of respondents), the same position as last year.\r\nThe perceived vulnerabilities associated with the Economic downturn risk are higher for younger age groups: it is ranked #3 for under 30s, #4 for the 30-39-year age group and #5 for the 40-49-year age group (Figure 1.2), but does not even feature in the top 10 for those aged 60 years or older.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/fgA-peISzmIpGkxY_qHXS9kBdZ4TzzwhaMVj_YbNjP8.png)\r\n\r\n### 1.2 The path to 2027\r\n\r\nThe global outlook for 2027 is one of increased cynicism among survey respondents, with a high proportion of respondents to the GRPS 2024-25 anticipating turbulence (31%), a four percentage- point increase since last year’s edition (Figure 1.3). There is also a two percentage-point year-on-year increase to 5% in the number of respondents who are anticipating a stormy outlook – the most alarming of the five categories respondents were asked to select from – over the next two years.\r\nThe top risk for 2027 according to survey respondents is Misinformation and disinformation – for the second year in a row, since it was introduced into the GRPS risk list in 2022-23. Respondent concern has remained high following a year of “super elections”, with this risk also a top concern across a majority of age categories and stakeholder groups (Figures 1.6 and 1.7). Moreover, it is becoming more difficult to differentiate between AI- and human- generated Misinformation and disinformation. AI tools are enabling a proliferation in such information in the form of video, images, voice or text. Leading creators of false or misleading content include state actors in some countries.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/5M9ormUF6o7GzJYxQuNADh-2vi4b4z_Noz8iT4zn0nY.png)\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/ptYv3cMliArvlVU6rgL__OTDgS_SLed1TD2JlhqTkA4.png)\r\nIn a year that has seen the mass rollout of developments in AI and considerable experimentation with AI tools by companies and individuals, concerns about Adverse outcomes of AI technologies is low in the risk ranking. In fact, it has slightly declined in the two-year outlook, with the risk now ranking #31 compared with #29 in last year’s report. However, complacency around the risks of such technologies should be avoided given the fast-paced change in the field of AI and its increasing ubiquity. In this report we highlight how AI models are a factor in the relationship between technology and polarization. Section [1.5:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s32dE9B2fr2fUMTuKS-5SK_1NU4MUtJCclsQ8IGk5Zg/edit#heading=h.3rdcrjn) Technology and polarization explores the risks for citizens resulting from the combination of greater connectivity, rapid growth in computing power, and more powerful AI models. In Section [2.4:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s32dE9B2fr2fUMTuKS-5SK_1NU4MUtJCclsQ8IGk5Zg/edit#heading=h.3rdcrjn) Losing control of biotech? we highlight the role of AI in accelerating developments in this field, for both good and bad.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/8VcWWTHjSikuISA1RjcJPZ3oxuyWQ3n1rxplefJCG78.png)\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/NBjV4JtYjykJsj9LttH720--7r3aTqMhrMJYSHiIWLE.png)\r\nRespondents also express unease over Cyber espionage and warfare, which is #5 in the two-year ranking, echoing concerns outlined in the World Economic Forum's 2024 Chief Risk Officers Outlook, where 71% of Chief Risk Officers expressed concern about the impact of Cyber risk and criminal activity (money laundering, cybercrime etc.) severely impacting their organizations. The rising likelihood of threat actor activity and more sophisticated technological disruption were noted as particular concerns.\r\nElevated cyber risk perceptions are one aspect of a broader environment of heightened geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions, which is reflected in the two-year ranking of State-based armed conflict moving up from #5 in last year’s report to #3 now. The risk of further destabilizing consequences in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Sudan are likely to be amplifying respondents’ concerns. In a world that has been seeing an increasing number of armed conflicts for a decade, as detailed in Section [1.3:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s32dE9B2fr2fUMTuKS-5SK_1NU4MUtJCclsQ8IGk5Zg/edit#heading=h.3rdcrjn) \"Geopolitical recession\", national security considerations are increasingly dominating government agendas. That section of the report dives deep into the dangers of unilateralism taking hold, including its implications for deepening humanitarian crises.\r\nOverall, the GRPS risks with some of the sharpest rises in ranking compared to the previous year are geostrategic in nature. Biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons or hazards (#23) and Geoeconomic confrontation (#9) are up eight and five positions, respectively, since the GRPS 2023-24. Section [1.4:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s32dE9B2fr2fUMTuKS-5SK_1NU4MUtJCclsQ8IGk5Zg/edit#heading=h.3rdcrjn) Supercharged economic tensions explores how global geoeconomic tensions could unfold over the next two years.\r\nPrivate-sector concern with the two-year outlook for Geoeconomic confrontation has moved up from last year’s edition of the report, where it was not a top 10 risk; it now is #6. There is also concern among both governments and academia, who rank this risk #9 and #10, respectively (Figure 1.7).\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/D8VZ1JRIfgIIUURQqBI1rZM4xYmkRzj9K-sEh6BPCuI.png)\r\nLast year, two economic risks – Inflation and Economic downturn (recession, stagnation) – were new entrants in the top 10 ranking. Concerns around both have since subsided; in this year’s two-year risk ranking, there are no economic risks in the top 10. Inflation, which was #7 last year, has fallen to #29, with a similar decline for Economic downturn, which was #9 last year and is now #19. No stakeholder group selected either Inflation or Economic downturn as a top 10 risk, although there is ongoing concern about Debt among government stakeholders (at #7), and Crime and illicit economic activity among international organizations, private-sector and government respondents (#6, #7 and #8, respectively). Across stakeholders in the aggregate, however, there are some sharp upticks in economic risk perceptions, with Crime and illicit economic activity increasing 17 positions to #11, and Concentration of strategic resources at #12, up 12 positions from last year.\r\nThis overall mixed picture for economic risk perceptions is not mirrored in societal risk perceptions, which have risen and feature prominently in the two-year risk landscape. Inequality (wealth, income) is #7 and Societal polarization is even higher, at #4. Involuntary migration or displacement (#8), and Erosion of human rights and/or civic freedoms (#10) are also in the top 10. Lack of economic opportunity or unemployment has increased 17 positions from last year’s edition and is now #13. Inequality (wealth, income) is perceived as the most central, interconnected risk of all, with significant potential to both trigger and be influenced by other risks (Figure 1.8). The importance ascribed to this set of societal risks suggests that social stability will be fragile over the next two years, weakening trust and diminishing our collective sense of shared values. This is being felt not only within societies but also between societies and governments: the perceived risk of Censorship and surveillance (#16) is up five places compared to last year.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/p6MpAbxd0-0rbJ43soda2tVfxQBcag6tilsJ0ayTac0.png)\r\nFractures across societal lines are also relevant to environmental risks, which have become a more divisive issue in domestic politics in many countries in recent years. On aggregate across GRPS respondents, concerns about environmental risks are high over the two-year horizon. Respondents list Extreme weather events as the #2 most severe risk for 2027, with Pollution at #6, up four places\r\nfrom last year’s report. While Extreme weather events remain a persistent concern year-on-year – the risk was also ranked #2 last year – the uptick in Pollution demonstrates that environmental\r\nrisks that are often perceived as long-term threats are starting to be perceived with more certainty by respondents as short-term realities, as their effects become more apparent. Climate change is also an underlying driver of several other risks that rank high. For example, Involuntary migration or displacement is a leading concern, at #8.\r\nThe following sections explore in-depth three risk themes and examine how these could play out over the next two years. State-based armed conflict (#3) and Geoeconomic confrontation (#9) are, respectively, at the core of **Section 1.3: \"Geopolitical recession\"** and **Section 1.4: Supercharged economic tensions**, while **Section 1.5: Technology and polarization** explores the links between Societal polarization (#4), Misinformation and disinformation (#1), algorithmic bias and Censorship and surveillance (#16).\r\n\r\n### 1.3 \"Geopolitical recession\"\r\n\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/PS8I9SHLj_n0Jznjk4mE3JA8_F6EIa9BNErNEMK5VJU.png)\r\n\r\n* Over the next two years, uncertainty around the course of current conflicts and their aftermath is likely to remain high, and tensions elsewhere could escalate.\r\n* A loss of support for and faith in the role of international organizations in conflict prevention and resolution has opened the door to more unilateralist moves.\r\n* Humanitarian crises are multiplying and worsening, given funding constraints and major powers’ lack of sustained focus on them.\r\n\r\nState-based armed conflict (proxy wars, civil wars, coups, terrorism, etc.) was highlighted as by far the greatest risk for 2025 among the 33 risks ranked in the GRPS, with 23% of respondents anticipating a material global crisis. GRPS respondents cite Geoeconomic confrontation as well as the technology-related concerns Cyber espionage and warfare and Misinformation and disinformation among the risks most closely linked to State-based armed conflict (Figure 1.10).\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/8XuEzVmo-yyJ-8dz747pJJzD6up1rGOk9JrdMEoxVr4.png)\r\nConcern about this risk among respondents remains alarming on a two-year horizon, with State- based armed conflict ranked #3, increasing two positions from last year’s risk ranking.\r\nIn the EOS, Armed conflict – encompassing interstate, intrastate, proxy wars and coups – is identified as one of the top 10 global risks over the next two years. According to the EOS, this geopolitical risk ranks as the primary concern for executives in 12 countries, including Armenia, Israel, Kazakhstan and Poland, and features among the top five risks in an additional 11 economies, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia (Figure 1.11). Executives who prioritize this risk according to the EOS frequently cite a high perception of related risks, including Biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons or hazards and Geoeconomic confrontation.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/NoefpUIuDxXfAbQZGfhJlXx-8igM34NsFQXdWmawJj8.png)\r\nThe top ranking of State-based armed conflict may also demonstrate concern among respondents that we are in what has been termed a “geopolitical recession”7 – an era characterized by a high number of conflicts, in which multilateralism is facing strong headwinds. It can also be argued that such a geopolitical recession started almost a decade ago (see Figure 1.12). Since 2014, the number of armed conflicts has been elevated compared to the period from the 1990s to the early 2010s. Interstate conflicts, while they tend to present the greatest threats to global stability, only constitute a small proportion of the total number of armed conflicts, which also include one-sided, non- state and intrastate armed conflicts.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/VHujNZADFfrUUBig4sRV-t7KCzox0-Cngat--P4V9fI.png)\r\n\r\n#### Escalation pathways\r\n\r\nThe GRPS results are also likely to reflect the depth of respondents’ fears surrounding the two major current cross-border conflicts, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, and perhaps also concern around the risks of conflict over Taiwan, China.\r\nRegarding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the position taken by the new US administration will be critical to its evolution. Will the United States take a firmer stance towards Russia, counting on such a move acting as a deterrent to further Russian escalation, and/or will it increase pressure on Ukraine, including reducing financial support? In the latter case, European governments might increase their own support for Ukraine. The spectrum of possible outcomes over the next two years is wide, ranging from further escalation, perhaps also involving neighbouring countries, to uneasy agreement to freeze the conflict.\r\nIn the Middle East, any shift towards a full-scale Iran-Israel war over the next two years would draw in the United States further. Such a war would, in\r\nturn, generate more long-term instability in the entire region, including the Gulf economies, where US military bases could become targets. Meanwhile, recent political developments in Syria raise both opportunities and risks. Hopes are high that there could be a revitalization of the economy and a more inclusive political environment. However, building stability across Syria will be challenging, given the many competing interests that are involved. These include both domestic groups and foreign states; if other countries decide to intervene more heavily while the transition unfolds, this could lead to renewed confrontations.\r\nIn addition, conflict over Taiwan, China cannot be ruled out. Limited armed confrontation could be triggered more easily if global tensions are high around geoeconomic confrontation and if rhetoric is aggressive. Both the United States and China may go further in the coming years in undertaking military manoeuvres close to Taiwan, China designed to show strength and act as deterrent. A major risk is that just one such manoeuvre could be misinterpreted by the other side and/or lead to accidental loss of life or destruction of hardware, leading to tit-for-tat military escalation.\r\n\r\n### Waning appetite for multilateralism\r\n\r\nWith the world facing this wide spectrum of ongoing armed conflicts, and escalation risks in the two major cross-border conflicts, the current weakness of the multilateral security framework with the UN Security Council (UNSC) at its core is alarming. The UNSC has not managed to stop conflicts from escalating, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the wars in the Middle East and in Sudan.\r\n\r\nDespite discussions over the last year about reinvigorating UN peacekeeping operations, these are in decline on aggregate, with their size having been reduced from over 100,000 peacekeepers in 20168 to around 68,000 in 2024.\r\nThe UNSC faces ongoing structural challenges,10 and over the next two years risks having even less impact, given the new US administration’s likely less favourable stance towards the UN generally and its preference for seeking solutions to conflicts unilaterally. There is a danger that more governments lose faith not only in the UNSC, but in multilateralism as a forum for resolving conflicts, and that the world instead becomes more adversarial, with conflicts ending only via battlefield, winner-takes-all victories and not through negotiated, multistakeholder peace agreements. While there continue to be discussions that aim towards reform of the UNSC, they are unlikely to make meaningful progress over the next two years given the complexity of aligning national interests and the current lack of political will to do so. Furthermore, there is no viable alternative global governance set-up in sight.\r\nThe growing vacuum in ensuring global stability at a multilateral level will lead governments around the world increasingly to take national security matters into their own hands, coordinating security and defense efforts only with select allied countries, or making unilateral military decisions. More countries will attempt to gain a greater degree of autonomy and self-sufficiency. Defense budgets could be prioritized over other long-term investments, placing at risk spending in areas such as healthcare, education and infrastructure. This accelerating military spending would represent a continuation of recent trends: World military expenditure increased for the ninth consecutive year in 2023, reaching a total of $2.4 trillion,11 with 2023 seeing a steep rise over 2022 (see Figure 1.13). The top five countries accounted for 61% of the total. As governments with strengthening militaries perceive that multilateral constraints on unilateral military action are weaker, there could be more instances of cross-border military interventions in the coming years.\r\nUnilateralism and the dominance of national security considerations in political agendas may also have increasingly far-reaching repercussions for state-society relations worldwide. Increased state surveillance of citizens and restrictions on individual freedoms may become more commonplace in the name of national security. Perceived or actual threats from other countries also provide an opening for governments to seize control of narratives and suppress information, perhaps blurring the lines between genuine security considerations and political expedience. Governments may take measures that diminish the transparency of public expenditure, for example when it comes to funding parties to a conflict abroad. These are all conditions that will help authoritarian regimes consolidate their power and may lead to democratic regimes taking on more authoritarian characteristics.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/PqkIjRONsWZd_nV1QNStyxMePjU1_zjxV_NjYWii3cU.png)\r\n\r\n### Worsening humanitarian crises\r\n\r\nEven beyond global security considerations, multilateralism appears set to endure its most difficult period since the founding of the UN in 1945. Over the next two years, more questions are likely to be asked by national governments about the roles and priorities of key multilateral institutions, and there could be constraints placed on their funding. The outlook for this broader weakening of multilateralism is associated with declining global budgets for humanitarian aid (see Figure 1.14).\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/tIuxgBZBBsMbywrS_QcUyzDA8P4FPMjURPkAtY7OTEw.png)\r\nDeclining funding translates into an acute risk of humanitarian crises deepening. Global humanitarian efforts are highly dependent on the financial and human resources and institutional know-how provided by the UN. This know-how, in areas such as logistics or relationships with local governments and NGOs, has been built up over decades and is irreplaceable over a short- or even medium- term time horizon. Over 90 million people in need receive humanitarian aid or development assistance from UN institutions on an annual basis. A rising number of these individuals, as well as others who also need support but are unable to access it, will be at increasing risk of insecurity, disease, malnutrition and starvation over the next two years if UN institutions and the humanitarian sector overall are weakened further.\r\nFurthermore, higher levels of desperation will in some settings create more opportunities for armed groups to recruit. Countries in which serious humanitarian crises risk deepening further over the next two years and in turn fueling more violence include Sudan, Mali and Haiti. In Sudan, the domestic and regional impacts of reduced agricultural production and exports are already far-reaching. Like Ukraine, Sudan is a large exporter of agricultural products. It plays a critical role for neighbouring countries Ethiopia, South Sudan, Chad and Egypt.\r\nForced displacement is also set to rise as international humanitarian aid efforts struggle to keep up. It is already at an all-time high, with over 122 million forcibly displaced people globally,14 and 56% are displaced within their own countries. Among the 44% who are cross-border refugees, three quarters are hosted in low-income countries that have limited resources to support them.\r\nSometimes refugees are confronted with nationalist sentiment or identity-related violence because of their ethnicity or religion, further fueling the potential for conflict in border areas. Increased competition for jobs between refugees and locals can also be a source of tensions.\r\nRising unilateralism will have softer implications, too. Societies are developing more disinterested mindsets when it comes to conflicts and humanitarian crises\r\nin which their own citizens are not involved. As local media deprioritize reporting on “far-away” conflicts, a self-fulfilling cycle emerges, with greater tolerance by governments and societies of civilian casualties in warfare. This is a risk that has already started unfolding with respect to current conflicts, for example when it comes to Sudan: This war\r\nhas rarely been at the top of global policy agendas despite its huge humanitarian toll. Such disinterest makes internationally coordinated humanitarian responses more difficult, especially when combined with the prevailing geopolitical and funding conditions.\r\n\r\n### Actions for today\r\n\r\n#### Support multilateral institutions\r\n\r\nThe GRPS finds that the approach that respondents believe has the most long-term potential for driving action on risk reduction and preparedness regarding State-based armed conflict is Global treaties and agreements (Figure 1.15. See also Figure 1.16), followed by Multistakeholder engagement.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/wgTbs3pSY1gUZrCCdwGrVKj7kbHIm1-qKhxGFXdko5E.png)\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/5T7bnwqfWkYXwXPXFa53Siftg6OSa1BG6xcdYb2-92w.png)\r\nThese findings strongly suggest that it is critical for public, private and civil society stakeholders across all countries to work together to reinforce existing multilateral institutions wherever feasible. This includes the UN Security Council; despite the challenges and complexity of reforming it, governments should continue dialogues with that ultimate objective in mind.\r\nIn highlighting the benefits of multilateralism in conflict resolution, leaders should draw on case studies of resolution of seemingly intractable conflicts. An example was the Colombian government’s peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in November 2016. Broad international cooperation has also helped to tackle armed threats, for example in combating piracy off the Somali coast over the course of many yearfrom 2008. Global leaders can draw optimism from such examples and showcase lessons learned and actionable strategies for ending current conflicts.\r\n\r\n#### B. Expand the role of regional organizations in managing tensions\r\n\r\nAmid the current challenges facing global multilateralism, there is space for regional organizations to expand their roles in managing geopolitical tensions in their regions. The African Union is a good example: It already has a track record in this regard, having carried out several peacekeeping operations across Africa and on other occasions has played a mediator role. Nonetheless, there is a need for it to play a greater role in future in both peacekeeping and mediation.\r\n\r\n#### C. Diversify supply chains\r\n\r\nFor organizations, one of the big lessons taken from the ongoing conflicts is the need for supply chain resilience and diversification. With geopolitical volatility likely to remain high over the next two years, organizational investment in geopolitical risk foresight and risk management is a must. When the level of uncertainty around conflicts or potential conflicts is high, scenario planning exercises can be a valuable tool to help organizations prepare for a range of different outcomes. Organizations need to consider not only whether their suppliers and supply routes are vulnerable to conflicts, but also what the reputational risks are of partnering or doing business with counterparts that are in any way party to a conflict.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/WZPpeFXk5DMf7I8XclEC57S-HPL8E8MTNFqVOVwQiTs.png)\r\n\r\n* A worldwide escalation of broad tariff-based protectionism could lead to global trade declining.\r\n* Deeper decoupling of trade between West and East would have worldwide repercussions, even beyond trade relationships.\r\n* With economic growth in China and Europe already weak, an escalating trade war will introduce additional uncertainties into the global economic outlook.\r\n\r\nGlobal trade relations are tense and there is a risk of unpredictable and potentially sharp changes in trade policies worldwide. Geoeconomic confrontation (sanctions, tariffs, investment screening) ranks #3 for current (2025) risks according to the GRPS and #9 over a two-year horizon. This comes after trade tensions have already been rising steeply since 2017. According to Global Trade Alert, the number of harmful new policy interventions per year rose globally from 600 in 2017 to over 3,000 in each of 2022, 2023 and 2024.\r\nThe incoming US administration has suggested that it will implement higher tariffs on imports from all trading partners, often singling out China, as well as Mexico and Canada. While these statements may have been the opening gambits ahead of future negotiations covering trade and other issues, they undoubtedly are a signal to the rest of the world that deepening protectionism is on the agenda.\r\nUS trading partners are considering retaliatory measures, as well as the timing for potentially implementing them. Over the next two years, there is a significant risk of escalating tariffs and other trade-related protectionism globally, which could accelerate broader decoupling between the United States and China, and their respective allies. While Cold War-style rhetoric between the United States and China could ramp up and fuel trade tensions between the two blocs, even the many countries that are not aligned with either West or East would find themselves affected by these tensions.\r\nIn such an unfolding trade war scenario, initiatives currently underway could easily stall or come apart. For example, the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is more likely to face retaliation from trading partners; and efforts to cooperate in the area of digital regulation will come up against hardening negotiating positions. These and other initiatives need ongoing collaboration to keep moving forward.\r\n\r\n#### Across-the-board tariffs\r\n\r\nIn a worst-case scenario for tariff escalation over the next two years, governments would decide to impose tariffs not only on those countries/blocs imposing tariffs on them, but instead on all their trading partners. This widespread imposition of across-the-board tariffs globally would lead to a substantial contraction in global trade.\r\nThis scenario could originate from an escalation of the tariff conflict between the United States and China. The latter’s dominance of global export markets is at the core of the new US administration’s concerns. Not only in the United States, but manufacturing sectors worldwide have struggled to compete with Chinese products in a range of sectors, such as solar panels or electric vehicles. While Chinese exports slowed from 2022- 2023, their growth has remained strong over a five-year timeframe.\r\nIf Chinese access to the US market is constrained by new tariffs, Chinese exports will be likely to flow to EU and other markets. But the EU has already started pushing back in selected areas of trade with China, for example imposing tariffs on electric vehicles imports from China for a period of five years in October 2024. If faced with a potential influx of Chinese imports redirected from the United States, the EU might impose new tariffs on Chinese imports.\r\nOther regions such as Latin America could take similar approaches in the face of diverted imports as they aim to defend local industries. Over the next two years, this could lead to a pattern of rolling, progressive protectionism spreading worldwide, at different speeds in different sectors, going well- beyond bilateral tit-for-tat tariffs. Some governments would move more aggressively than others, and once the first countries impose across-the-board tariffs on their trading partners, more countries could quickly follow.\r\n\r\n#### Escalation beyond tariffs\r\n\r\nResearch published in November 2024 assessed the vulnerability of 173 countries to restrictive US trade measures. The research considers key concerns of US policy-makers, including those countries’ bilateral trade surpluses with the United States, restrictions on market access for US exports, and existing tariffs, among other criteria.20 Weighing the countries according to these criteria, South Korea is found to be the most at risk for being targeted with restrictive US trade measures, followed by China, Japan, Canada and India, at the next level of risk. However, other countries and blocs are found to be at risk, too: Brazil, the EU, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico and Thailand are the next group of economies.This assessment chimes with the results of the EOS, which show that geoeconomic confrontation (sanctions, tariffs, investment screening, etc.) is a prominent concern in Eastern Asia, in particular (Figure 1.18). In Taiwan, China and Hong Kong SAR, China, this risk is the third- most significant concern in their two-year outlooks. Moreover, 12 other economies, including Japan and South Korea, rank geoeconomic confrontation among their top 10 risks. While Eastern Asia may be one region most immediately impacted by new trade restrictions, broadening global geoeconomic fragmentation would affect all economies, with those likely to suffer the most ultimately being emerging markets and low-income countries.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/QrjxTpI0AZXhC4g_apa5mNaz8UYXAPxrV2SEnpmN09g.png)\r\nBeyond tariffs, industrial policy is at the core of other trade-related protectionist measures. The world is already in an era of industrial policy, with a high number of non-tariff barriers impacting trade relations. Two-thirds of all harmful trade restriction measures implemented in the last five years have been subsidies, excluding export subsidies.\r\nLegislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act24 or initiatives such as Make in India25 are a rising characteristic of countries’ inward focus and this trend could accelerate in a fragmenting trade environment. Although industrial policy can have benefits, for example addressing market failures, its risks include corruption and misallocation of resources.26 A related area likely to see escalation is more blocking of trade and investment on national security grounds, with the number of sectors classified by governments as “strategically sensitive” expanding.\r\nAs the space for a multilateral, rules-based and open global trade environment diminishes, government interventions in the private sector could be used more frequently as a form of retaliation against companies’ home governments. Employees of foreign companies could increasingly be prosecuted or have more restrictions placed on their in-country stays, and the number and size of fines imposed on companies for alleged regulatory non-compliance could be ratcheted up. Governments may make more use of sanctions targeting individuals, financial transactions and companies.\r\nSome governments may foment more aggressive Misinformation and disinformation campaigns about goods and services from targeted countries. Results from the EOS indicate widespread concerns about the Misinformation and disinformation risk in a diverse set of countries, including India (#2), Germany (#4), Brazil (#6), and the United States (#6). Hardening public perceptions could lead to more frequent consumer boycotts of products.\r\nCosts for companies doing business internationally will rise in this scenario. Global firms will need to navigate divergent sets of regulations in different, fragmenting parts of the world. Regulatory technology (RegTech) will be used more by governments to surveil foreign companies and ensure compliance,27 reducing the time between new regulations being imposed and the need for companies to become fully compliant. IT infrastructure as well as data security and storage protocols will continue to be adapted to national security interests at the expense of cross-border commercial considerations. Finally, international data flows and financial transactions will become more cumbersome and costly, setting back some of the rapid progress made in recent years through the implementation of new technologies.\r\nGovernment-led efforts at commercial cyber espionage could become more frequent as part of efforts to tilt the playing field towards their national champions. The EOS reveals that respondents in high- income countries tend to highlight cybersecurity risk. In some of these – for example Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands – Cyber insecurity is one of the top three risks. Governments may also put pressure on domestically headquartered cloud services companies to restrict access in other countries.\r\nSuch a global fragmentation scenario will weaken the kind of multilateral collaboration required in many fields. For example, coordinating regulatory efforts and mobilizing the vast financial resources needed for the green transition will become much more difficult. Technological innovations that might make a difference towards greening economies will face more impediments to being shared across borders and scaled globally. Other areas where deeper global collaboration is badly needed, such as global health, energy or infrastructure, will also be likely to see slowdowns or reversals in progress. This will leave the world less well prepared for the next global pandemic, for example, while urgent public health and broader humanitarian issues will slip even further down the global agenda. Contagion from trade disruptions could spill over into food insecurity, too. Some large cities in Sub- Saharan Africa that are reliant on global commodity markets for their food supply are particularly at risk.\r\n\r\n#### Greater economic uncertainty\r\n\r\nThe World Economic Forum’s September 2024 Chief Economists Outlook found that most of the chief economists surveyed (54%) expect the condition of the global economy to remain unchanged over the next year, but four times as many expect conditions to weaken (37%) rather than to strengthen (9%). This outlook aligns closely with the latest IMF forecast, which has economic growth stable at 3.2% annually in 2024 and 2025. Even without accounting for the potential impacts of downside risks, this growth rate is tepid compared to the long-term average growth rate of 3.8% from 2000-2019.\r\nThe IMF notes rising risks to the economy posed by conflict escalation, tariffs and trade policy uncertainty, lower migration, and the tightening of global financial conditions. The latter could pose a challenge to financial stability given that valuations are elevated in several asset classes and the amount of leverage used by financial institutions is significant. The rapid growth in the private credit market is one area to monitor. More generally, both government and private-sector debt levels continue to rise globally. There have been early signs that fiscal concerns could re-emerge over the next two years as markets will face a high volume of sovereign debt supply.\r\nGlobally, Economic downturn tops the EOS global risk ranking in the next two years. This risk ranks first in five regions: Latin America and the Caribbean, Northern America, Oceania, South-Eastern Asia and Southern Asia. It also ranks first in three out of the four country income groups, with the only exception being lower-middle income countries. Respondents in 25 countries see Economic downturn as the leading risk, including developed economies such as the United States and United Kingdom, and emerging markets such as Brazil, Kenya and Malaysia (Figure 1.19).\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/dAfGMWekZ49-nGLxgEQKf1sXKXKcAASoZMzPvOxK2EI.png)\r\nIn the short term, higher import tariffs cause an increase in the price of imported goods. The impact on global GDP depends on factors including the substitutability between imported and domestic goods; the response of exporting firms facing tariffs; and monetary policy reactions. When it comes to the latter, monetary policy-makers are in the fortunate position of having just brought inflation back under control. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects headline global inflation to fall to 3.5% by the end of 2025, which is lower than the average in the two decades prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, one risk is that an escalating trade war will lead to another upturn in inflation, forcing central banks to halt or even reverse course from cutting interest rates. If this is associated with a strengthening US dollar, there could be knock-on risks for countries and companies with US dollar debt refinancing needs.\r\nIndirect impacts of tariffs include a fall in productivity, due to a change in the allocation of productive resources from more to less productive, more protected sectors and firms; a rise in the cost of capital caused by financial stress; and a drop in investment due to an increase in uncertainty about future business conditions, which causes firms to adopt a “wait-and-see” approach. The latest World Investment Report, released in June 2024, cites fragmenting trade and regulatory environments as among the key drivers of a 10% slump in global foreign direct investment last year.\r\nAnalysis by the World Trade Organization (WTO) of the phase of the US-China trade conflict from 2018-2020 indicates that the direct impacts on the global economy of tariff increases during this period were far outweighed by the impacts of broader uncertainty around trade policy. With these broader impacts, the loss to global GDP was estimated at 0.34-0.50% during this period. A true global trade war would have correspondingly more severe impacts, with estimates of global GDP losses highly uncertain but potentially much higher.\r\nThe US-China trade conflict since 2018 also had clear business impacts: exits of foreign companies from China increased by 34% compared to pre- 2018 levels. Importantly, the impacts were much broader than only in the specific sectors targeted by US tariffs on Chinese products and affected non- US companies as well as US companies. These findings suggest that even the “scalpel” approach – levying tariffs on specific sectors – does not have a well-targeted outcome in terms of either sector or geography. To reiterate, a broader global trade war would magnify these impacts on businesses.\r\n\r\n### Actions for today\r\n\r\n#### A. Foster multilateralism\r\n\r\nThe GRPS finds that the approach that has the most long-term potential for driving action on risk reduction and preparedness regarding Geoeconomic confrontation is Global treaties and agreements (Figure 1.20). A specific area to prioritize would be a revival of reforms at the WTO to address dispute resolution, tariff-setting rules and digital trade issues. With US-China Geoeconomic confrontation at the core of a fragmenting world, more opportunities will open up for rising powers, such as India or the Gulf countries, to fill the void and propose multilateral alternatives to the current global political economic order. These countries can also benefit by acting as a bridge between West and East, even though they too will suffer many of the negative impacts of the fragmenting environment. Smaller countries will face increasing pressure to align with the West or the East in their trade relationships.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/cVpwsOQy0jBRudIbYffUpxCf0rF8SQYlBB2OxN4ef4I.png)\r\n\r\n#### B. Develop strategic relationships\r\n\r\nGovernments could consider further prioritizing efforts to develop strategic regional or bilateral ties with countries that offer complementarity in terms of sectoral strengths, natural resource endowments and skills. “Deep” regional trade agreements – outside the WTO but consistent with WTO requirements – and WTO-based plurilateral or “minilateral” agreements can be considered (Figure 1.21).45 Even at these levels, multistakeholder dialogue needs to be deepened to reinforce the message that well- designed deepening of trade can lead to mutually beneficial economic and social outcomes.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/4ZQNtoLytkfqDhKfi-RDVXKAhdRHLfzpTJ8y1TpxjSU.png)\r\n\r\n#### Strengthen domestic economic resilience\r\n\r\nIn an environment where trade becomes more costly and cumbersome, emphasis needs to be placed on policies that strengthen the domestic economy, such as financial sector development or investment in education, health and infrastructure. On the supply side, developing greater self-sufficiency in key strategic sectors such as Energy, Agriculture, and Defense will increasingly become an important aspect of resilience at the national level.\r\n\r\n### 1.5 Technology and polarization\r\n\r\n\\- Rising use of digital platforms and a growing volume of AI\\-generated content are making divisive misinformation and disinformation more ubiquitous\\.\r\n\\- Algorithmic bias could become more common due to political and societal polarization and associated misinformation and disinformation\\.\r\n\\- Deeper digitalization can make surveillance easier for governments\\, companies and threat actors\\, and this becomes more of a risk as societies polarize further\\.\r\nAn estimated two-thirds of the world’s population – 5.5 billion people46 – is online and over five billion people use social media.47 The increasing ubiquity of sensors, CCTV cameras and biometric scanning, among other tools, is further adding to the digital footprint of the average citizen. In parallel, the world’s computing power is increasing rapidly.48 This is enabling fast-improving AI and GenAI models to analyse unstructured data more quickly and is reducing the cost to produce content. With Societal polarization ranking #4 in the GRPS two-year ranking, the vulnerabilities associated with citizens’ online activities look set to continue deepening hand in hand with societal and political divisions. Taken as a whole, these developments threaten to fundamentally undermine individuals’ trust in information and institutions.\r\nLike last year, Misinformation and disinformation tops this year’s GRPS two-year ranking. The amount of false or misleading content to which societies are exposed continues to rise, as does the difficulty that citizens, companies and governments face in distinguishing it from true information. The interplay of rising Misinformation and disinformation with political and Societal polarization creates greater scope for algorithmic bias. If human, institutional and societal biases are not addressed, and/or best practices in modelling are neglected, the conditions will be ripe for algorithmic bias to become more prevalent. Such bias, whether inherent in data, models or their creators, can lead to unjust outcomes.\r\nDespite the dangers related to false or misleading content, and the associated risks of algorithmic bias, citizens need to strike a balance between privacy on one hand and increased online personalization and convenience on the other hand. While data governance and regulation vary worldwide, it is becoming easier for citizens to be monitored, enabling governments, technology companies and threat actors to reach deeper into people’s lives. Those with access to rising computing power and the ability to leverage sophisticated AI/GenAI models could, if they choose to, exploit further the vulnerabilities provided by citizens’ online footprints. Rising political and Societal polarization could become more of a driving force for such increased surveillance.\r\n\r\n#### Misinformation and disinformation in a polarized world\r\n\r\nThe advent of new technologies and the increase in user-generated content platforms is leading to a corresponding rise in the volume of content online. Flows of Misinformation and disinformation from those creating it are becoming more challenging to detect and remove in an increasingly fragmented media landscape.\r\nDifferentiating between AI- and human-generated false or misleading content – in the form of video, images, voice or text – can be difficult. GenAI lowers the barriers for content production and distribution, and some of that content is inaccurate. Threat actors, state agencies in some countries,49 activist groups, and individuals who may or may not have criminal intentions can automate and expand disinformation campaigns, greatly increasing their reach and impact.50 Misinformation and disinformation can also be the result of AI-hallucinated content or human error, and these too are likely to rise amid the growing volume of content.\r\nThe upshot is that it is becoming increasingly hard to know where to turn for true information. Both political and Societal polarization skew narratives and distort facts, contributing to low and declining trust in media.51 Across a sample of 47 countries, only 40% of respondents said that they trusted most news.52\r\nAccording to the EOS, respondents in high-income countries are generally more likely to express concern about the risk of Misinformation and disinformation over the next two years than respondents in lower-income countries, with some exceptions. This risk ranks among the top five in 13 countries, including India, Germany and Canada, and features in the top 10 in 30 additional countries (Figure 1.23). Respondents identifying this risk often also highlight Societal polarization as one of the most severe risks in the same timeframe. Poor quality content and lack of trust in information sources continue to present a threat to societies.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/0MXvOPyxcm-KpqEDnvOvtGo4_1xEx4ijoKSHoFb8EmM.png)\r\nAlgorithms, especially complex machine learning models, can also be an entry point for cyberattacks that use disinformation. An example of this would be a structured query language injection attack, in which inputs are manipulated to generate incorrect outcomes or to compromise training data sets.54 As many models lack transparency, either by intention, by accident, or because of intrinsic opacity, it\r\nis difficult to identify vulnerabilities and mitigate potential threats. In addition, given the reliance of algorithms on third-party data sources, software libraries and network infrastructures, threat actors can compromise the supply chain to manipulate algorithms and cause widespread damage. Further, as algorithms come to govern or influence more aspects of society, the potential for coordinated cyberattacks using automated systems grows.\r\n\r\n#### Algorithmic bias\r\n\r\nAlgorithmic bias can both be influenced by Misinformation and disinformation and can be a cause of it. The risks of algorithmic bias are heightened when the data used for training an AI model is itself a biased sample. Sometimes, the bias can be obvious. For example, in a hiring process, a set of bios used as examples of good candidates might be drawn from a pool of previous candidates, all of whom might have the same gender, race or nationality. Other times, a bias can be less obvious: for example, a model could be trained on citizens’ previous spending on education, without accounting for certain minority groups typically spending less on education. Synthetic data may be used, aiming to remove bias, but that can itself introduce new biases.\r\nExamples of biases against citizens include waiting times for a government appointment being assigned on the basis of a questionable set of input data and criteria, or automated responses failing to respond adequately to citizens’ needs. When algorithms are applied to sensitive decisions, biases in training data or assumptions made during model design can perpetuate or exacerbate inequities, further disenfranchising marginalized groups.\r\nPredictive policing is one area where algorithmic bias based on race can be a concern. Such risks are heightened further when there is no human participation in decision-making.\r\nUnless there are clear accountability frameworks in place, the use of automated algorithms makes it challenging to assign responsibility when harmful or erroneous decisions are made, especially when AI is involved. Automated algorithms often operate as “black boxes”, making it difficult for individuals to understand how decisions are made. This lack of transparency and accountability can foster mistrust and skepticism about the fairness and accuracy of decisions taken.\r\nIn many cases, algorithmic bias can be the result of lack of knowledge, testing or sufficient oversight. How a model is developed, applied and governed is key to mitigating these risks. Independently of the input dataset used, the personal biases of individuals designing the assumptions of the model can also play a role in leading to unjust outcomes. These personal biases may be accidental (for example, the result of those inputting the data having insufficient technical expertise) or intentional, for example, to pursue political aims.\r\nOne risk that could come into focus more over the next two years is algorithmic bias against people’s political identity.58 Algorithmic political bias might be used intentionally to, for example, affect recruitment into public-sector jobs or access to certain public services or financial services. What makes this risk especially dangerous is that individuals’ political biases are widely known, and those biases can easily find their way into algorithms or data sets.\r\nFurthermore, individuals’ political views can increasingly be determined, even against their will, from their online activities.\r\nSimilarly to individual biases, societal biases can also play a role.60 These are likely to become more prevalent as societal divisions deepen. In the GRPS, Societal polarization is ranked #4 over a two-year time horizon. Regionally, Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern Asia and Europe manifest the most pressing concerns over Societal polarization in the next two years, according to the EOS.\r\n\r\n#### Citizen surveillance risks\r\n\r\nGovernment technology (GovTech) is entering a new era, as AI, data analytics and digital platforms become the backbone of public administration. Technology companies have long worked closely with governments, for example, in the sensitive Defense and Intelligence sectors. More recently, a broader range of government services, including other sensitive domains such as taxation, environmental protection, and voter verification and registration, have also become increasingly technology-dependent. Governments now have unprecedented access to data on citizens – and technology companies often have even better access than the governments themselves do. As the computing power available to governments and technology companies continues to rise, it becomes easier for both entities to monitor citizens’ activities.\r\nWhen managed responsibly, analysis and processing of citizen data enables governments and the technology companies with whom they work to enhance public services. This can remain beneficial for citizens if effective legal guardrails are in place and both governments and technology providers act in ways that earn trust. However, without these conditions, the risks of misuse of surveillance capabilities rise.\r\nThere is divergence worldwide around how governments can use the data that they can access, reflecting ideology and culture, as well as the technological capacity and resources available to each government. Regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also play a role, aiming to enhance personal data protection by placing stricter limits on data usage by governments and businesses.\r\nMeanwhile, citizens often remain unaware of how their personal data is collected, used and shared, limiting their ability to make informed decisions. Figure 1.24 shows the close connectivity between Censorship and surveillance, Societal polarization, Misinformation and disinformation and Online harms, highlighting the confluence of these risks in the digital ecosystem.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/G5NeVbcEIrlaP400juJUWSSFjjeyRWTmxFbZGQUb0D0.png)\r\nCensorship and surveillance ranks #16 in the GRPS risk ranking on a two-year outlook, increasing five positions since last year, showing that concern respondents have around this issue is real and growing. In a world of deepening societal and political divisions, amplified by eroding trust in the digital environment, concerns with Censorship and surveillance are most pronounced in Eastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Central Asia, according to the EOS (Figure 1.25). Notably, Nicaragua ranks this risk as the fourth- most severe threat over the next two years, while eight other economies identify it among their top 15 risks.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/I-keprP2EjC0SbiFlW3cqYcUG_BXO5bhK33UQVIHd1I.png)\r\n\r\n#### Actions for today\r\n\r\nExpand upskilling for people building and using automated algorithms Organizations should use AI models that minimize bias and mitigate unintended consequences in content creation and distribution. While technical solutions for significantly debiasing automated algorithms already exist, their consistent application remains a challenge. If implemented correctly, these solutions could greatly reduce the risks associated with model bias. Common debiasing strategies include data pre-processing before training a model, in-processing techniques during training, and post-processing steps after training. These methods help ensure that AI models are fairer and more equitable.\r\nHowever, due to the rapid pace of change in AI development and the increasing complexity of its applications, keeping up with the latest advancements in algorithmic debiasing is difficult for many involved in building and using automated algorithms. To address this, there is a pressing need for continuous upskilling of developers, data scientists and policy-makers. Governments, civil society and academia should collaborate to create comprehensive training programmes that are frequent, regular, and reflect the latest advancements in AI and algorithmic fairness. These programmes should focus not only on technical skills but also emphasize the importance of ethical decision- making, responsible data-handling, and the societal impact of AI systems.\r\n\r\n#### B. Boost funding for digital literacy\r\n\r\nThe GRPS finds that Misinformation and disinformation and Societal polarization are the two risks for which Public awareness and education has the most long-term potential for driving action on risk reduction and preparedness (Figure 1.26). Censorship and surveillance is also within the top five risks that could be addressed in this way. There is an urgent need for comprehensive public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about the risks associated with digital spaces, as well as the tools and practices they can use to protect themselves and boost trust in their use of platforms. For example, citizens should be educated on privacy and security settings for their devices, including two-factor authentication, and app permissions. Awareness programmes should also cover recognizing phishing attempts, protecting personal data, and securely navigating social media. Additionally, digital literacy initiatives should help individuals understand the role of algorithms and data in shaping their online experiences, fostering critical thinking to identify and challenge biased or harmful content. Governments, civil society and private-sector organizations all have a role in promoting these campaigns, ensuring they are accessible to diverse populations.\r\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/YwYhNJcZA0Spim5I4sImQcfOwI6AB2bnIYOZvWx4BR0.png)\r\n\r\n#### C. Improve accountability and transparency frameworks\r\n\r\nThe World Economic Forum’s Digital Trust Framework68 spells out key governance themes for ensuring AI’s sustainable and responsible adoption. They include accountability and transparency.\r\nThe former could involve establishing supervisory boards and AI councils, as well as human oversight processes. These committees should consider diverse perspectives from technologists, ethicists, legal experts, creators and others to effectively assess GenAI products and features. They should be responsible for reviewing AI practices, identifying potential risks and ensuring compliance with both internal policies and external regulations.\r\nRegarding transparency, nurturing consumers’ trust requires organizations to inform about AI- generated content and its use through appropriate labelling and disclosures. Information on related data practices, safety policies and potential risks (such as bias and privacy) of the AI model used\r\nin GenAI products should be made available via accessible documentation. Standards and technical solutions to ensure content authenticity – such as digital watermarking, content origin and history, and blockchain-based rights management – are currently under development to support a trustworthy information ecosystem. However, successful adoption at scale requires policy frameworks that are aligned with common principles, rules and technological standards.",

    "content": "**Combined Summary: Financial Stability Risks from Trade Uncertainty and Geopolitical Shocks (Chapters 1 & 2)**\r\nBoth Chapter 1 (\"Enhancing Resilience amid Global Trade Uncertainty\") and Chapter 2 (\"Geopolitical Risks: Implications for Asset Prices and Financial Stability\") highlight a significant increase in risks to global financial stability. This heightened risk stems from a confluence of factors, primarily driven by:\r\n\r\n1. **Elevated Geopolitical Risks and Trade Uncertainty:** Geopolitical risks, encompassing conflicts, sanctions, and diplomatic tensions, have risen notably, contributing to an all-time high in economic and trade policy uncertainty. The surprise magnitude of US tariff announcements in April 2025 and subsequent retaliatory measures are a prime example of how such policy uncertainty can trigger financial market turmoil.\r\n2. **Tightening Global Financial Conditions:** Amid this uncertainty, global financial conditions have tightened, marked by abrupt movements in asset prices and increased volatility.\r\n\r\nThe report identifies several key findings and vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n* **Market Volatility and Asset Price Corrections:** While market reactions to geopolitical events are often modest on average, major events (especially military conflicts) trigger significant, persistent adverse impacts on asset prices. The April 2025 tariff announcement caused swift and widespread market volatility. Despite recent sell-offs, valuations remain stretched in some segments (US tech, corporate bonds) relative to the grimmer outlook and elevated uncertainty, foreboding further potential corrections. Tail risks in markets have also increased, particularly after major shocks.\r\n* **Strains on Financial Institutions:** High leverage in the financial system, particularly among Nonbank Financial Intermediaries (NBFIs) like hedge funds and asset managers, poses a significant risk. Growing interconnectedness with banks means that strains at highly leveraged NBFIs (e.g., due to margin calls or forced deleveraging following asset price drops) can amplify market turmoil and spread stress to the broader banking system. Private credit funds' reliance on bank financing and increasing cross-border links are also vulnerabilities. Banks, while profitable recently, face headwinds from trade impacts and potentially understated risks from internal capital models (RWA density). Major geopolitical events can adversely affect bank capital (especially in EM) and weigh on lending.\r\n* **Sovereign Bond Market Turbulence:** High government debt levels and increased financing needs (for both advanced economies and emerging markets) come at a time of challenged bond market functioning. Central bank quantitative tightening means more debt must be absorbed by price-sensitive private investors. Dealer intermediation capacity is constrained, making markets fragile. Geopolitical events, especially military conflicts, significantly increase sovereign risk premiums, particularly for emerging markets and commodity importers with weaker buffers (fiscal and reserve) or institutional quality.\r\n* **Vulnerabilities in Emerging Markets and Frontier Economies:** These economies face significant headwinds from trade tensions (weighing on growth/stocks) and tighter global conditions. High financing needs, increased interest expenses, depressed currencies, and higher capital outflow risks are concerns. Nonresident interest in local currency bond markets remains subdued. Frontier economies face high yields and market access risks. Investment funds with exposure to affected countries face lower returns and outflows.\r\n* **Risks in Specific Sectors and Countries:** China faces exacerbated deflationary pressures from tariffs, bond market risks from declining yields and concentrated institutional holdings, and leverage risks from NBFI repo activity. Corporate sectors globally face widening spreads, rising bankruptcies, and refinancing challenges; EM firms are especially vulnerable to FX volatility and USD debt burdens. Households face increased vulnerability from high equity/real estate exposure and rising delinquencies for certain debt types. The commercial real estate sector shows uneven signs of stabilization with persistent stress in office properties and large refinancing needs.\r\n\r\n**Policy Recommendations:**\r\nTo enhance resilience amid this uncertain backdrop, the report recommends a comprehensive set of policies:\r\n\r\n1. **Strengthen Preparedness and Crisis Management:** Authorities must be prepared for financial instability, ensuring financial institutions have tested access to central bank liquidity facilities (including for nonbanks with guardrails) and being ready for early intervention in core markets. Robust recovery and resolution frameworks are essential for dealing with weak or failing institutions.\r\n2. **Calibrate Macroeconomic Policies:** Central banks should carefully assess price dynamics and calibrate monetary policy appropriately (easing where growth/inflation momentum is slowing, remaining restrictive where inflation is stubborn). Fiscal adjustments should focus on credible, growth-friendly rebuilding of buffers to manage high financing needs and contain borrowing costs.\r\n3. **Enhance Prudential Supervision and Regulation:** Implement Basel III and other international standards fully and consistently to address bank risk-weight variability. Conduct intensive, independent supervision, including stress testing bank exposures (e.g., to CRE). Enhance the assessment and management of risks stemming from bank-NBFI linkages. Strengthen policies to mitigate risks from nonbank leverage, including better reporting requirements and cross-sectoral coordination.\r\n4. **Utilize Macroprudential Tools:** Calibrate macroprudential buffers to increase resilience against shocks where buffers are insufficient, or release them to support credit provision during a downturn.\r\n5. **Manage Sovereign Debt Proactively:** Explore liability management operations to manage refinancing risks. For countries with unsustainable debt, prompt engagement with creditors is crucial for orderly debt treatment.\r\n6. **Tailor Policies for Emerging Markets:** Implement policy responses consistent with the IMF's Integrated Policy Framework, including appropriate use of exchange rate flexibility, FX intervention, or capital flow management based on country-specific circumstances. Deepen financial markets and improve regulatory frameworks to support hedging. Maintain adequate macroeconomic policy space and international reserve buffers. Policymakers and financial institutions in these countries should specifically consider country-specific geopolitical risks in their oversight and risk management.\r\n7. **Address Crypto Asset Risks:** Implement the IMF/FSB road map and relevant standards consistently and coordinately to safeguard monetary sovereignty, manage capital flow volatility, ensure clear tax treatment, and monitor/supervise activities falling under existing regulations.\r\n8. **Enhance International Cooperation:** Strengthen multilateral surveillance to monitor global shocks and spillovers. Reinforce the global financial safety net to enable swift and effective mitigation of systemic risks. Financial institutions themselves should devote adequate resources to identifying, quantifying, and managing geopolitical risks in their own operations.",

    "content": "# ECB Financial Stability Report—2025\r\n\r\n**Share this page on Facebook, X, LinkedIn, or by email**  \r\n**Data available as: CSV, JSON and XML**\r\n\r\nA stable and efficient financial system is essential for sustainable growth and prosperity in the euro area. The ECB’s Financial Stability Review assesses the resilience of the euro area financial system and highlights key risks that could undermine its stability. Financial stability ultimately benefits all Europeans.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the ECB’s framework for assessing financial stability and explore the [ECB Financial Stability Dashboard](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/html/index.en.html).\r\n\r\n## Overall Assessment\r\n\r\n### Key Takeaways\r\n\r\n- Financial stability vulnerabilities remain elevated in the euro area amid heightened geopolitical and policy uncertainty, persistent market volatility, and structural challenges.\r\n- While inflation pressures are receding and monetary policy has started to ease, growth prospects are subdued and risks are tilted to the downside.\r\n- Sovereign vulnerabilities are increasing, especially in high-debt countries, due to weak fiscal fundamentals and sluggish potential growth.\r\n- The banking sector remains resilient, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers, but faces rising credit risk in some segments and moderating profitability.\r\n- Non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) are increasingly exposed to market and liquidity risks, with growing interconnectedness and leverage amplifying vulnerabilities.\r\n- Macroprudential policy has focused on maintaining resilience, with increased capital buffer requirements and ongoing reforms to address risks in both the banking and non-bank sectors.\r\n\r\n## The Euro Area Financial System in 2025: Resilience Amid Uncertainty\r\n\r\nSince late 2024, the euro area has faced a volatile macro-financial environment. Geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainty, and global trade frictions have triggered bouts of market volatility and heightened the risk of tail events. While financial markets have so far absorbed these shocks, underlying vulnerabilities—such as high asset valuations, risk concentration, and liquidity mismatches—persist.\r\n\r\n## Macro-Financial and Geopolitical Risks\r\n\r\n- The balance of risks has shifted from inflation concerns to fears of weaker growth, with structural headwinds compounding cyclical challenges.\r\n- Geopolitical risks, including ongoing conflicts and trade tensions, have increased uncertainty and could trigger further market volatility or abrupt shifts in sentiment.\r\n- Fiscal challenges remain acute in several euro area countries, with high debt levels and limited policy space to respond to shocks.\r\n\r\n## Households\r\n\r\n- Household vulnerabilities have eased, supported by robust employment, wage growth, and higher savings, but pockets of risk remain among low-income and highly indebted households.\r\n- Debt-to-income ratios have declined to levels last seen in 2005, but debt service costs remain elevated for some cohorts.\r\n- A high propensity to save is supporting household balance sheets but may weigh on consumption and slow the economic recovery.\r\n\r\n## Non-Financial Businesses\r\n\r\n- Corporate balance sheets are under pressure from high funding costs and weak growth, especially in commercial real estate (CRE) and among SMEs.\r\n- Insolvencies are rising from low levels, reflecting the phasing-out of pandemic support and continued economic weakness.\r\n- New borrowing remains subdued, with tight lending standards and weak demand, particularly in capital-intensive sectors.\r\n\r\n## Sovereign and Market Risks\r\n\r\n- Sovereign vulnerabilities are rising due to high debt, weak fiscal fundamentals, and policy uncertainty, especially following recent elections in some countries.\r\n- Market volatility has increased, with sharp but short-lived corrections in equity and bond markets. High valuations and risk concentration, especially in technology stocks, raise the risk of abrupt repricing.\r\n- The euro area remains exposed to global spillovers, particularly from the US and China, and to risks from further geopolitical fragmentation.\r\n\r\n## Banking Sector Resilience\r\n\r\n- Euro area banks remain resilient, with strong capital and liquidity buffers and historically low non-performing loan (NPL) ratios.\r\n- Asset quality is deteriorating slowly, mainly in CRE, SMEs, and consumer credit, but exposures are manageable in aggregate.\r\n- Bank profitability remains high but is moderating as net interest income peaks and lending margins compress.\r\n- Market valuations of banks remain subdued, reflecting concerns about growth and structural challenges.\r\n\r\n## Non-Bank Financial Sector\r\n\r\n- NBFIs play a growing role in market-based finance but face valuation, liquidity, and leverage risks, especially in investment funds and insurers.\r\n- High concentration in equity holdings, increased exposure to US assets, and liquidity mismatches in open-ended funds amplify vulnerabilities.\r\n- The insurance sector remains resilient, but climate-related risks and the insurance protection gap are growing concerns.\r\n\r\n## Macroprudential Policy and Outlook\r\n\r\n- Macroprudential authorities have increased capital buffer requirements and maintained borrower-based measures to preserve resilience.\r\n- Ongoing reforms aim to enhance the policy framework for NBFIs, address liquidity and leverage risks, and improve data sharing and supervision.\r\n- Progress on the capital markets union and further integration of supervision are key to supporting productivity, growth, and financial stability.\r\n\r\n## Data and Further Reading\r\n\r\n- [ECB Financial Stability Review, November 2024](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/financial-stability-publications/fsr/html/ecb.fsr202411~dd60fc02c3.en.html)\r\n- [ECB Financial Stability Dashboard](https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/reports.do?node=1000004859)\r\n- [ECB Macroprudential Bulletin](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/financial-stability-publications/macroprudential-bulletin/html/index.en.html)\r\n- [ECB Explainers on Financial Stability](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/explainers/topic/financial-stability/html/index.en.html)\r\n\r\n**For more data and interactive visualizations, visit the [ECB’s Financial Stability Data Portal](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/html/index.en.html).**\r\n\r\n*This report is based on the ECB’s Financial Stability Review (November 2024) and related ECB sources.

    "content": "Your assessment provides a very good, comprehensive overview of climate-related financial risks, their types, why they are important, the financial impacts, a methodology for assessment, challenges, and opportunities. It's well-structured and covers many foundational aspects.\r\n\r\nHere's a comparison focusing on what the speech emphasizes and where your analysis could be augmented or draw further parallels:\r\n\r\n## Key Topics from the Speech and How Your Assessment Relates:\r\n\r\n### 1. Evolution and Urgency (Decade Advanced, Growing Threat):\r\n*   **Speech:** Strongly emphasizes that these risks are \"a decade advanced and pose a growing threat,\" citing recent disasters as evidence of \"crystallisation of physical risks.\"\r\n*   **Your Assessment:** You define physical and transition risks well.\r\n*   **Potential Addition/Enhancement:** You could strengthen your introduction or \"Why is it Important?\" section by explicitly referencing this *increasing urgency* and the *crystallisation* of these risks, perhaps even citing similar recent examples to underscore the timeliness. The speech frames this as a key motivator for the updated expectations.\r\n\r\n### 2. Regulatory Context (BoE/PRA Journey, SS3/19):\r\n*   **Speech:** Heavily contextualized within the BoE/PRA's journey, referencing SS3/19, Dear CEO/CFO letters, CBES, and the new consultation.\r\n*   **Your Assessment:** Mentions \"Regulatory Pressure\" generally.\r\n*   **Potential Addition/Enhancement:** If your target audience includes UK financial institutions or those interested in the UK regulatory landscape, explicitly mentioning key BoE/PRA milestones like SS3/19 and the ongoing development of supervisory expectations would add significant depth and relevance, mirroring the speech's context.\r\n\r\n### 3. Emphasis on Actionable Scenario Analysis:\r\n*   **Speech:**\r\n    > \"Greater emphasis on the rigorous use of scenario analysis. Firms will be expected to show a strong understanding of how they will take the outputs from the scenarios they design and construct and use them to *actively inform the business decisions* they take.\"\r\n*   **Your Assessment:** Your \"Methodology\" includes \"Assess the identified risks\" which mentions scenario analysis.\r\n*   **Potential Addition/Enhancement:** While your methodology is sound, the speech highlights a shift towards ensuring scenario analysis isn't just an exercise but a core input into *actual business strategy and decision-making*. You could elaborate in your \"Assess\" or \"Manage\" steps on how scenario outputs translate into tangible business actions and strategic adjustments.\r\n\r\n### 4. Governance and Risk Appetite:\r\n*   **Speech:**\r\n    > \"Stressed the need for further integration of climate risk into firms’ governance frameworks... need for firms to have a clear statement of risk appetite that cascades down from the top of the firm to individual business lines. Senior management will therefore need to ensure they have appropriate analysis to allow them to understand the risks they are accepting.\"\r\n*   **Your Assessment:** Your \"Methodology\" under \"Manage Risks\" mentions \"integrating climate risk into existing risk management frameworks and governance structures.\"\r\n*   **Potential Addition/Enhancement:** The speech is more specific about the *board-level articulation of risk appetite* for climate risks and how this should permeate the organization. You could add a sub-point under \"Manage Risks\" or create a small section on \"Governance and Risk Appetite,\" emphasizing the top-down approach and senior management accountability highlighted by the PRA.\r\n\r\n### 5. Proportionality:\r\n*   **Speech:**\r\n    > \"We expect each firms’ approach to scale with the level of risk to which they are exposed... Where a firm has determined that it faces a less material impact, it may choose to scale its risk management response accordingly...\"\r\n*   **Your Assessment:** This principle isn't explicitly discussed.\r\n*   **Potential Addition/Enhancement:** This is a key aspect of the PRA's supervisory approach. Adding a note about the principle of proportionality – that the sophistication of a firm's climate risk management should be commensurate with its exposure – would be a valuable addition, especially in the \"Methodology\" or \"Challenges\" sections.\r\n\r\n### 6. International Standards and Disclosures (ISSB/UK SRS):\r\n*   **Speech:**\r\n    > \"PRA continues to be a strong supporter of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the development of a framework for UK Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS). Comprehensive and consistent disclosures should support transparency and the efficient management of climate risk.\"\r\n*   **Your Assessment:** Your \"Methodology\" includes \"Monitor & Report,\" which covers reporting to stakeholders.\r\n*   **Potential Addition/Enhancement:** Explicitly mentioning the drive towards standardized disclosures (like ISSB) in your \"Monitor & Report\" section or under \"Regulatory Pressure\" would align well with the speech's strong endorsement and highlight a critical developing area.\r\n\r\n### 7. Consolidation and Clarification of Existing Expectations:\r\n*   **Speech:**\r\n    > \"These are expectations, not rules. They are enhancements... and do not represent a change of direction... consolidate and clarify the feedback that the PRA has provided publicly...\"\r\n*   **Your Assessment:** N/A as your page is an assessment, not a regulatory update. However, understanding this nuance is important when interpreting regulatory communications.\r\n\r\n### 8. Role of Industry Collaboration (CFRF):\r\n*   **Speech:** Highlights the importance of bodies like the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) for building capacity and sharing best practice.\r\n*   **Your Assessment:** Not directly applicable to the content of a risk impact assessment itself, but good contextual awareness.\r\n*   **Potential Addition/Enhancement:** In a broader discussion of how firms can tackle these challenges (perhaps linked from \"Challenges\" or \"Opportunities\"), mentioning the value of industry collaboration and leveraging resources from forums like CFRF could be relevant.\r\n\r\n## Topics Your Assessment Covers Well (and are also in the speech):\r\n*   Definitions of Physical and Transition Risks: Clear and aligned.\r\n*   Impact on Firms' Ability to Support Clients & Own Resilience: Implicit in your \"Financial Impact Assessment\" sections.\r\n*   Importance for Financial Stability: Covered in your \"Why is it Important?\" section.\r\n*   Types of Financial Impacts: Your breakdown (Asset Valuation, Credit Risk, etc.) is thorough.\r\n\r\n## Summary of Recommendations for Your Assessment:\r\nTo align more closely with the specific nuances and forward-looking elements of the PRA speech, consider:\r\n*   Increasing the sense of urgency and current impact: Emphasize the \"crystallisation\" of risks.\r\n*   Adding specific regulatory context (UK/PRA focused): Mention SS3/19 and the evolving supervisory landscape if relevant to your audience.\r\n*   Deepening the discussion on Scenario Analysis: Stress its role in *informing active business decisions*.\r\n*   Elaborating on Governance: Specifically mention board-level risk appetite statements and senior management accountability.\r\n*   Introducing the Principle of Proportionality in risk management approaches.\r\n*   Highlighting the move towards standardized disclosures (ISSB/UK SRS) in your reporting section.\r\n\r\nYour assessment is already a strong foundational piece. Incorporating these elements, particularly those reflecting the *evolution* and *practical application* of climate risk management as emphasized by the PRA, would make it even more current and impactful, especially for those operating within or observing the UK financial regulatory environment.\r\n\r\nhttps://my-portfolio-menno.vercel.app/risk/climate-financial-impact",

    "content": "# Enhanced Security Features Users Known Locations\r\n\r\nTo enhance security by using location-based data for TOTP requests, you can implement a system that checks the travel time between the known location from a previous login and the new location. This ensures that the travel time does not exceed what is realistically possible, adding an extra layer of security. Here’s how you can approach this:\r\n\r\n### Steps to Implement Location-Based Security for TOTP\r\n\r\n1. **Capture Location Data**: When a user logs in, capture their location data (e.g., using IP geolocation).\r\n2. **Store Previous Location**: Store the location data securely along with the timestamp of the login.\r\n3. **Calculate Distance and Travel Time**: When a new login attempt is made, calculate the distance between the previous location and the new location.\r\n4. **Determine Maximum Possible Travel Time**: Use the maximum speed of commercial airplanes to determine the minimum possible travel time between the two locations.\r\n5. **Compare Travel Time**: Compare the calculated travel time with the actual time elapsed between the two logins.\r\n6. **Additional Verification**: If the travel time is unrealistic, prompt the user for additional verification.\r\n\r\n### Example Calculation\r\n\r\n#### Step 1: Capture and Store Location Data\r\n\r\n* **Previous Login**: Location A (e.g., New York, USA), Timestamp: 2025-03-14 10:00 AM\r\n* **New Login**: Location B (e.g., Tokyo, Japan), Timestamp: 2025-03-15 10:00 AM\r\n\r\n#### Step 2: Calculate Distance\r\n\r\n* **Distance**: Approximately 10,800 km (using online distance calculators).\r\n\r\n#### Step 3: Determine Maximum Possible Travel Time\r\n\r\n* **Average Speed of Commercial Airplane**: 900 km/h.\r\n    * Set variabel User Allowed Travel Type: Walking (5 km/h), Car (120 km/h) or Airplane (900 km/h)\r\n* **Minimum Travel Time**:Travel Time=10,800 km900 km/h=12 hoursTravel Time=900 km/h10,800 km​=12 hours\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Compare Travel Time\r\n\r\n* **Actual Time Elapsed**: 24 hours.\r\n* **Comparison**: Since 24 hours is greater than the minimum travel time of 12 hours, the travel is possible.\r\n\r\n#### Step 5: Additional Verification\r\n\r\n* If the calculated travel time was less than the minimum possible travel time, prompt the user for additional verification (e.g., SMS OTP, email verification). To verify location and stop a potential risky login.\r\n\r\n### Tools and Libraries\r\n\r\n* **Geolocation API**: To capture and determine user location.\r\n* **Distance Calculation API**: To calculate the distance between two locations.\r\n* **Travel Time Calculation**: Use average speeds of commercial airplanes for realistic travel time estimates.\r\n\r\n### Security Considerations\r\n\r\n* **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on location-based checks to prevent abuse.\r\n* **Data Privacy**: Ensure that location data is stored securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.\r\n* **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provide alternative verification methods if location-based checks fail.\r\n\r\nBy implementing these steps, you can add a robust layer of security to your TOTP system, ensuring that login attempts are realistic and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\r\nTo enhance security by verifying open sessions and their known locations upon login, you can implement a system that compares the current login location with the locations of existing sessions. This helps detect suspicious activity and adds an extra layer of security. Here’s how you can approach this:\r\n\r\n### Steps to Verify Open Sessions and Compare Locations\r\n\r\n1. **Capture Current Login Location**: When a user logs in, capture their current location using IP geolocation.\r\n2. **Retrieve Open Sessions**: Retrieve all active sessions for the user from your session management system.\r\n3. **Compare Locations**: Compare the current login location with the locations of the open sessions.\r\n4. **Determine Travel Time**: Calculate the travel time between the previous known location and the new login location.\r\n5. **Verify Feasibility**: Ensure the travel time is realistic. If the travel time is impossible, prompt the user for additional verification.\r\n\r\n### Example Implementation\r\n\r\n#### Step 1: Capture Current Login Location\r\n\r\n* **Action**: Use an IP geolocation service to determine the user's current location upon login.\r\n\r\n#### Step 2: Retrieve Open Sessions\r\n\r\n* **Action**: Query your session management system to get all active sessions for the user. This includes session IDs, timestamps, and locations.\r\n\r\n#### Step 3: Compare Locations\r\n\r\n* **Action**: Compare the current login location with the locations of the open sessions.\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Determine Travel Time\r\n\r\n* **Action**: Calculate the distance between the previous known location and the new login location.\r\n* **Formula**:Travel Time=DistanceSpeedTravel Time=SpeedDistance​Use the maximum speed of commercial airplanes (approximately 900 km/h) for the calculation1.\r\n\r\n#### Step 5: Verify Feasibility\r\n\r\n* **Action**: Compare the calculated travel time with the actual time elapsed between the sessions.\r\n* **Example**:\r\n    * **Previous Session**: Location A (e.g., New York, USA), Timestamp: 2025-03-14 10:00 AM\r\n    * **New Login**: Location B (e.g., Tokyo, Japan), Timestamp: 2025-03-15 10:00 AM\r\n    * **Distance**: Approximately 10,800 km\r\n    * **Minimum Travel Time**:Travel Time=10,800 km900 km/h=12 hoursTravel Time=900 km/h10,800 km​=12 hours\r\n    * **Actual Time Elapsed**: 24 hours\r\n    * **Comparison**: Since 24 hours is greater than the minimum travel time of 12 hours, the travel is possible.\r\n\r\n### Additional Verification\r\n\r\n* **Action**: If the travel time is unrealistic, prompt the user for additional verification (e.g., SMS OTP, email verification).\r\n\r\n### Tools and Libraries\r\n\r\n* **Geolocation API**: To capture and determine user location.\r\n* **Distance Calculation API**: To calculate the distance between two locations.\r\n* **Session Management System**: To manage and retrieve active sessions.\r\n\r\n### Security Considerations\r\n\r\n* **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on location-based checks to prevent abuse.\r\n* **Data Privacy**: Ensure that location data is stored securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.\r\n* **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provide alternative verification methods if location-based checks fail.\r\n\r\nBy implementing these steps, you can add a robust layer of security to your TOTP system, ensuring that login attempts are realistic and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\r\n\r\n## One Uniqueness Too Many preferably All\r\n\r\nConfirm One from Many to ensure only one unique owner is present among all.\r\nSES CBA o3b mPower - One To Many Confirmation - How fast to retrieve confirmation global one of many confirmations on uniqueness of existence.

Segregating Satellite from terrestrial networks. A similar engagement between the blurring of responsible ownership in Banking and IT (FinTech) that cannot do without the other but should remain very clearly segregated to avoid confusion between ownership of the technology and the ownership of a banking license. Among other similar the software and hardware where hardware has software implemented as in Rom and Ram is used during the computers usage. Whereby the ROM which mainly initially was identified as a BIOS got blurred and not see allot of ROM back into practices.\r\n**However, the lines are blurring somewhat in modern telecommunications:**\r\n\r\n* **Convergence:** The industry is moving towards convergence, where companies are offering bundled services that may combine satellite, fiber, cable, and mobile technologies.\r\n* **Integration:** Some telecommunications groups might integrate satellite capabilities more closely into their overall service portfolio, especially for expanding reach to underserved areas or for backup/resiliency.\r\n* **Example - VodafoneZiggo (Liberty Global JV):** Even though VodafoneZiggo in the Netherlands is primarily a cable and mobile operator, Vodafone (one of the parent companies) has broader interests in satellite and other technologies globally. There might be some level of coordination or leveraging of expertise within the larger Vodafone group, even if VodafoneZiggo's day-to-day operations are focused on terrestrial networks.\r\n\r\nYou've highlighted a very important point about the **need to maintain segregation of duties and separate licensing** in industries that are becoming increasingly intertwined, especially when dealing with critical infrastructure and regulated sectors. Your examples of satellite/terrestrial networks, banking/FinTech, and hardware/software (ROM/RAM) are excellent analogies to illustrate this principle.\r\nLet's break down why this segregation is crucial and how it applies to these different domains:\r\n**1\\. Importance of Segregation of Duties and Separate Licensing:**\r\nThe core rationale behind maintaining segregation and separate licensing stems from several key factors:\r\n\r\n* **Risk Management and Accountability:** Segregation of duties ensures that no single entity has unchecked power or control over all aspects of a critical system. Separate licensing creates clear lines of responsibility and accountability for different functions. This is vital for risk management, as it prevents single points of failure and makes it easier to identify and address issues.\r\n* **Regulatory Clarity and Oversight:** Different types of services and infrastructure often fall under different regulatory regimes. For example, satellite communications are regulated differently from terrestrial telecommunications, and banking is regulated distinctly from technology provision. Separate licensing allows regulators to apply appropriate oversight and rules tailored to the specific risks and characteristics of each sector. Blurring these lines can create regulatory gaps and loopholes.\r\n* **Preventing Conflicts of Interest:** Segregation of duties can prevent conflicts of interest. For instance, if a company both owns the core infrastructure *and* provides regulated services on top of it, there's a potential conflict. They might favor their own services or engage in anti-competitive practices. Separate licensing and ownership structures can mitigate these conflicts.\r\n* **Promoting Innovation and Competition:** While it might seem counterintuitive, segregation can sometimes *promote* innovation. By separating infrastructure providers from service providers, you can create a more level playing field for competition and innovation at different layers of the value chain. Smaller, specialized companies can innovate in services or technology without needing to control the entire stack.\r\n* **Ensuring Stability and Resilience:** In critical industries, stability and resilience are paramount. Segregation of duties and licensing can contribute to a more robust and resilient ecosystem. If one part of the system fails (e.g., a service provider has issues), the underlying infrastructure (e.g., the network) can remain stable and be used by other providers.\r\n\r\n**2\\. Segregating Satellite from Terrestrial Networks:**\r\nAs you pointed out, maintaining a degree of segregation between satellite and terrestrial networks is important for the telecommunications industry:\r\n\r\n* **Different Licensing Regimes:** Satellite spectrum and orbital slots are licensed and regulated internationally and nationally, often by different bodies than those regulating terrestrial spectrum and networks. Combining licensing could create significant regulatory complexity.\r\n* **Different Infrastructure and Expertise:** Operating satellites and terrestrial fiber/cable networks require very different technical expertise, infrastructure, and operational models. Trying to manage them under a completely unified structure could lead to inefficiencies and diluted expertise.\r\n* **Different Use Cases and Markets:** While there's convergence, satellite and terrestrial networks often serve different primary use cases and markets. Satellite excels in broadcast, remote areas, and mobility, while terrestrial networks are dominant for mass-market broadband in dense areas. Maintaining some specialization allows for better focus on these distinct needs.\r\n* **Resilience and Redundancy:** Having both satellite and terrestrial networks as somewhat separate ecosystems provides valuable redundancy for the overall communication infrastructure. If terrestrial networks are disrupted (e.g., by a major disaster), satellite communications can still be available, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n**3\\. Banking and FinTech – Segregation of Banking License vs\\. Technology Ownership:**\r\nYour banking and FinTech example is particularly relevant:\r\n\r\n* **Banking License as a Regulated Activity:** Holding a banking license is a heavily regulated activity because banks handle public money and are crucial to the financial system's stability. Banking licenses come with stringent capital requirements, compliance obligations, and regulatory oversight.\r\n* **FinTech Innovation in Technology:** FinTech companies often innovate in technology related to financial services – payment systems, lending platforms, investment tools, etc. They are technology providers.\r\n* **Need for Clear Segregation:** It's crucial to maintain a clear segregation between:\r\n    * **Entities that hold banking licenses and perform regulated banking activities.** These entities are subject to full banking regulation.\r\n    * **Technology providers (FinTechs) that *enable* or *support* financial services but do not themselves hold banking licenses.** FinTechs might be regulated in specific areas (e.g., data privacy, anti-money laundering), but not to the same extent as licensed banks.\r\n* **Avoiding \"Shadow Banking\" and Regulatory Arbitrage:** Without clear segregation, there's a risk of \"shadow banking\" – entities performing banking-like functions without being subject to banking regulations. This can create systemic risks and undermine the stability of the financial system. Similarly, unclear lines could lead to regulatory arbitrage, where companies try to exploit loopholes by blurring the lines between regulated and unregulated activities.\r\n\r\n**4\\. Hardware and Software \\(ROM/RAM\\) – Conceptual Segregation:**\r\nYour hardware/software analogy, especially the ROM/RAM example, is insightful for understanding layered systems:\r\n\r\n* **Hardware (Foundation):** Hardware is the physical foundation – the computer itself, the network cables, the physical infrastructure. It's relatively fixed and provides the basic capabilities. Think of terrestrial networks as the \"hardware\" of communication.\r\n* **Software (Operating Logic and Applications):** Software is the set of instructions and logic that runs on the hardware. It's more flexible and can be updated and changed. Think of satellite communications as a specific \"software\" or application of communication technology, operating alongside terrestrial \"hardware.\"\r\n* **ROM (BIOS – Initial Foundation):** ROM (Read-Only Memory), particularly the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) initially, is like the *firmware* deeply embedded in the hardware. It's the foundational software that boots up the system and provides basic functions. Early ROM was very fixed and separate.\r\n* **RAM (Working Memory - Dynamic):** RAM (Random Access Memory) is the working memory where software runs and data is processed dynamically. It's more flexible and volatile.\r\n* **Blurring Lines, but Conceptual Segregation Remains Useful:** While modern systems are much more complex, and the lines between firmware, operating systems, and applications are less rigid than in the past, the *conceptual* segregation of hardware and software layers remains vital for system design, understanding, and management. You still need to understand the foundational hardware layer separately from the software running on top. Similarly, understanding the distinct roles of satellite and terrestrial networks, even as they converge, is crucial.\r\n\r\n**The Blurring Lines and the Challenge:**\r\nYou are correct that in all these areas (telecoms, finance, computing), the lines are becoming increasingly blurred due to technological convergence and integration. This creates challenges for maintaining effective segregation of duties and relevant licensing frameworks.\r\n**The Key is to Evolve Regulatory and Operational Models:**\r\nThe solution is not necessarily to rigidly enforce complete separation in all cases, as that might stifle innovation and efficiency. Instead, the approach needs to be:\r\n\r\n* **Adaptable Regulatory Frameworks:** Regulatory frameworks need to evolve to recognize the blurring lines but still maintain core principles of risk management, consumer protection, and fair competition. This might involve new types of licenses, more nuanced regulations, and greater inter-agency cooperation.\r\n* **\"Layered\" Security and Responsibility Models:** Even with integration, it's essential to maintain layered security and responsibility models. Clearly define who is responsible for what at different layers of the technology stack or service delivery chain.\r\n* **Transparency and Disclosure:** Increased transparency and disclosure are crucial. When services become more integrated, it's important for users and regulators to understand who is providing what part of the service and who is accountable for different aspects.\r\n* **Focus on Outcomes and Principles, Not Just Rigid Separation:** The goal is not to maintain absolute separation for its own sake but to achieve the underlying objectives: risk management, accountability, fair competition, and stability. The methods to achieve these objectives may need to adapt to the changing technological landscape, even if it means some blurring of traditional lines.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, your point about maintaining segregation of duties and separate licensing, even as industries converge, is highly relevant and insightful. It's a fundamental principle for responsible development and stability in critical sectors, and it requires careful consideration and adaptive approaches as technology continues to evolve.\r\nNot only legal basis or a data processing agreement with consent of the subject parties to ensure clarity remains in which part is processed where and the maintenance of responsible ownership.",

In the Financial Stability Report, the Bank of Canada assesses the resilience of the Canadian financial system and focuses on key risks that could undermine its stability. Ultimately, financial stability benefits all Canadians.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the Bank of Canada's framework for assessing financial stability and explore our [interactive data visualization dashboard](/risk/canadian-financial-stability).\r\n\r\n## Overall Assessment\r\n\r\n### Key Takeaways\r\n\r\n- Canada's financial system is resilient. Overall, households, businesses, banks and non-bank financial intermediaries successfully weathered the pandemic, a period of elevated inflation, and sharp increases in interest rates.\r\n- Over the past 12 months, Canadian households have been carrying, on average, less debt relative to their income, and insolvency filings by businesses have dropped significantly. But there are pockets of financial stress.\r\n- The economic impacts of the pandemic, as well as elevated housing prices due to persistent imbalances in the housing market, have led to higher levels of debt for some households and businesses, making them more vulnerable to financial shocks.\r\n- Recently, large and abrupt shifts in the direction of US trade policy have led to some bouts of extreme market volatility, including in the normally low-risk market for US Treasuries.\r\n- The trade war currently threatens the Canadian economy and poses risks to financial stability. Near-term unpredictability of US trade and economic policy could cause further market volatility and a sharp repricing in assets, leading to strains on liquidity.\r\n- In the medium to long term, a prolonged global trade war would have severe economic consequences, potentially leading to widespread defaults on household and business debt.\r\n\r\n## The Financial System Began 2025 with Increased Resilience\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the 2024 Report until the beginning of 2025, major central banks eased monetary policy as inflation fell worldwide. Lower policy interest rates helped reduce vulnerabilities in the financial system related to debt serviceability.\r\n\r\nDespite brief periods of volatility in global markets, Canadian fixed-income and other core funding markets functioned well, and debt issuance conditions remained solid. Banks maintained elevated levels of capital and liquid assets. Non-financial businesses also kept healthy balance sheets. As interest rates declined, the pressure on businesses and households with variable-rate debt and those facing mortgage renewals also eased.\r\n\r\n## The Trade War and Pervasive Uncertainty Have Rattled Markets\r\n\r\nSince January, the unpredictability of US trade policy has caused a sharp increase in uncertainty and market volatility. The new tariffs announced by the United States in early April were significantly larger than market participants had anticipated. This led to sharp repricing in equity, bond and currency markets as investors revised their economic outlooks.\r\n\r\nBenchmark equity indexes fell sharply before recovering almost entirely, while stock market volatility rose to its highest level since the COVID-19 crisis. Sovereign bond yields in Canada and the United States saw large swings. Many investors appeared to diversify away from US assets. The US dollar and US Treasuries weakened in tandem with stocks instead of playing their traditional safe-haven roles amid uncertainty.\r\n\r\n## Households\r\n\r\nMany households continue to adjust to higher debt-servicing costs that were a key concern in the previous Report. Mortgage holders have proved resilient in the face of higher payments. Signs of financial stress have increased over the past 12 months but remain concentrated among households without a mortgage.\r\n\r\nWhile interest rates have come down significantly over the past year, previous increases in interest rates are still affecting mortgage renewals. A large share of mortgages being renewed this year or next were taken out during the pandemic at historically low interest rates. Despite rates being much lower than they were 12 months ago, most of these households will still see payment increases when they renew.\r\n\r\nWhile indebtedness remains elevated, it has come down over the past 12 months—the ratio of household debt to disposable income has declined from 179% to 173%. With interest rates lower now than a year ago, the Bank is less concerned about the impact of high borrowing costs on debt serviceability.\r\n\r\nHowever, the trade war is threatening jobs and incomes, particularly in trade-dependent industries. Some affected households may become unable to continue making debt payments, which could lead to credit losses at banks.\r\n\r\n## Non-Financial Businesses\r\n\r\nNon-financial businesses adjusted well to past interest-rate increases and have generally remained in solid financial health over the past 12 months. Larger firms have been supported by their diversified sources of funding and by the fact that most have long-term financing in place. Last year's surge in insolvency filings by small businesses proved temporary, as anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe trade war will test the financial resilience of businesses in industries tied to trade. Those with existing vulnerabilities—high leverage, weak profitability and low cash reserves—are at risk of falling behind on debt payments, which could lead to losses for both banks and investors.\r\n\r\n## Banks\r\n\r\nCanadian banks remain well positioned to support the financial system and the broader economy, even through a period of financial stress. They have good access to funding through deposits and wholesale markets, and credit performance has been strong.\r\n\r\nBanks have increased their accumulated provisions for anticipated loan losses and maintain elevated capital levels to absorb unexpected losses. Stress-testing exercises conducted with the IMF show that even in a severe economic scenario with a 5.1% GDP decline and 9.2% unemployment, bank capital would remain above regulatory minimums.\r\n\r\n## Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries\r\n\r\nAs the activities of non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) have evolved, so have the risks associated with them. Some asset managers have taken on higher levels of leverage in Canada, leaving them vulnerable to sudden demands for liquidity, such as through margin calls.\r\n\r\nCanadian and foreign-based hedge funds have become increasingly active participants in Canadian government bond and repo markets. They now buy almost 50% of the auction volume in some tenors of Government of Canada bonds and represent about 30% of the volume of trades in the secondary market.\r\n\r\nA shock that leads hedge funds to suddenly withdraw from these markets could amplify financial stress, as seen in US bond markets in early April. The trade war increases the risk of even more frequent and severe shocks in the future.\r\n\r\n## Key Risk Monitoring Focus\r\n\r\nThe Bank will closely monitor:\r\n\r\n- **Indicators of financial stress**—such as delinquency rates for businesses and households\r\n- **Evidence of precautionary behaviour**—such as borrowers drawing on lines of credit more than usual\r\n- **Availability of credit**—particularly for workers and firms in sectors heavily exposed to tariffs\r\n- **Conditions for funding and market liquidity**—especially in government bond and repo markets\r\n\r\nThe Bank will continue to work closely with federal and provincial financial authorities to monitor and assess the health of Canada's financial system and to address potential emerging issues. The objective is to foster a stable and resilient financial system that absorbs shocks and can support the economy through periods of turbulence.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*This analysis was produced by the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada: Tiff Macklem, Carolyn Rogers, Toni Gravelle, Sharon Kozicki, Nicolas Vincent, Rhys Mendes and Michelle Alexopoulos.*\r\n\r\n**Read the [full interactive report](/risk/canadian-financial-stability) with data visualizations.**",

    "content": "# Building a Full-Stack Portfolio with Next.js and ASP.NET Core\r\n\r\nAs developers, our portfolios are not just showcases of our work, but living demonstrations of our technical abilities. While my Next.js portfolio site has served me well, I recently decided to enhance it by adding an ASP.NET Core backend. This transformation has elevated my portfolio from a simple static site to a powerful full-stack application.\r\n\r\n## Why Add .NET to a Next.js Portfolio?\r\n\r\nNext.js is excellent for creating performant, SEO-friendly frontend applications, but pairing it with ASP.NET Core brings several advantages:\r\n\r\n1. **Showcasing Full-Stack Expertise**: Demonstrates proficiency in both modern JavaScript frameworks and enterprise-grade backend technologies\r\n2. **Enhanced Performance**: ASP.NET Core's high-performance capabilities for handling data operations\r\n3. **Advanced Features**: Simplified implementation of complex features like real-time analytics and secure admin panels\r\n4. **Enterprise Readiness**: Shows potential employers your ability to work with technologies commonly used in enterprise environments\r\n\r\n## Architecture Overview\r\n\r\nThe architecture I implemented follows a clean separation of concerns:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy-portfolio/\r\n├── src/                 # Next.js frontend\r\n│   ├── app/             # Next.js app router\r\n│   ├── components/      # React components\r\n│   └── lib/             # Frontend utilities\r\n├── api/                 # ASP.NET Core backend\r\n│   ├── Controllers/     # API endpoints\r\n│   ├── Models/          # Data models\r\n│   ├── Services/        # Business logic\r\n│   └── Data/            # Data access\r\n└── shared/              # Shared types and utilities\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Features Implemented\r\n\r\n### 1\\. Performance\\-Optimized Blog Engine\r\n\r\nI replaced the file-based blog with a SQL Server database managed by Entity Framework Core, enabling:\r\n\r\n* Faster search and filtering\r\n* Advanced caching strategies\r\n* Better content management\r\n* Improved analytics\r\n\r\nThe blog posts are now stored in a structured database, allowing for more complex queries and content relationships.\r\n\r\n### 2\\. Cross\\-Posting Analytics Dashboard\r\n\r\nOne feature I'm particularly proud of is the cross-posting analytics dashboard. It:\r\n\r\n* Tracks all blog posts cross-posted to platforms like Hashnode and Dev.to\r\n* Displays performance metrics for posts across platforms\r\n* Shows which topics perform best on different platforms\r\n* Visualizes post engagement over time\r\n\r\nThis was implemented with a dedicated `BlogCrossPostController` in the .NET API that collects and analyzes cross-posting data.\r\n\r\n### 3\\. Secure Admin Panel with JWT Authentication\r\n\r\nThe admin experience is now significantly improved:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Token generation for secure admin access\r\nvar securityKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_config[\"Jwt:Key\"]));\r\nvar credentials = new SigningCredentials(securityKey, SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256);\r\n\r\nvar token = new JwtSecurityToken(\r\n    issuer: _config[\"Jwt:Issuer\"],\r\n    audience: _config[\"Jwt:Audience\"],\r\n    expires: DateTime.Now.AddHours(3),\r\n    signingCredentials: credentials\r\n);\r\n\r\nreturn new JwtSecurityTokenHandler().WriteToken(token);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4\\. Contact Form with Email Integration\r\n\r\nI integrated a contact form that:\r\n\r\n* Stores submissions in the database\r\n* Sends email notifications using SendGrid\r\n* Implements rate limiting and spam protection\r\n* Provides a management interface for responses\r\n\r\n## Development and Deployment Process\r\n\r\n### Local Development\r\n\r\nFor seamless local development, I set up Docker Compose to run all components:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# docker-compose.yml\r\nversion: '3'\r\nservices:\r\n  nextjs:\r\n    build: .\r\n    ports:\r\n      - \"3000:3000\"\r\n    environment:\r\n      - DOTNET_API_URL=http://api:5000\r\n  \r\n  api:\r\n    build: ./api\r\n    ports:\r\n      - \"5000:80\"\r\n    environment:\r\n      - ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection=Server=db;Database=PortfolioDB;...\r\n      \r\n  db:\r\n    image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest\r\n    # Database configuration...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Deployment Architecture\r\n\r\nFor production, I deployed:\r\n\r\n* Next.js frontend on Vercel\r\n* ASP.NET Core API on Azure App Service\r\n* Database on Azure SQL\r\n\r\nThis provides excellent scalability while keeping costs reasonable.\r\n\r\n## Performance Improvements\r\n\r\nThe switch to a .NET backend yielded impressive performance gains:\r\n\r\n| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ----- | ----------- |\r\n| Blog Loading Time | 840ms | 320ms | 62% faster |\r\n| API Response Time | 500ms | 180ms | 64% faster |\r\n| Admin Operations | 1.2s | 400ms | 67% faster |\r\n\r\n## Lessons Learned\r\n\r\nBuilding this full-stack solution taught me several valuable lessons:\r\n\r\n1. **Integration Complexity**: Building bridges between Next.js and .NET required careful planning of APIs and authentication flows.\r\n2. **Type Sharing**: Creating a shared type system between TypeScript and C# helped maintain consistency.\r\n3. **Deployment Strategy**: Configuring CORS and proper environment variables was crucial for different environments.\r\n4. **Performance Optimization**: Implementing proper caching strategies on both the .NET API and Next.js side was essential.\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nI'm planning to add:\r\n\r\n1. Real-time notifications using SignalR\r\n2. Advanced analytics with ML.NET for content recommendations\r\n3. A multi-tenant version for other developers to use\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nAdding an ASP.NET Core backend to my Next.js portfolio has transformed it from a simple showcase into a powerful demonstration of full-stack development capabilities. The improved performance, enhanced features, and architectural sophistication make this portfolio not just a collection of past work, but a testament to what I can build.\r\n\r\nFor developers looking to stand out, I highly recommend going beyond a standard static portfolio and creating something that truly demonstrates your range of skills. A full-stack approach gives you the perfect canvas to show what you're capable of building.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in seeing how this implementation works, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-username/portfolio) or [reach out](mailto:contact@yourdomain.com) with any questions!",

While such individuals often challenge the status quo and drive innovation, their approach may also create friction within established boundaries and processes.\r\n\r\n## What is a Disruptive Rebel?\r\nA disruptive rebel is someone who questions existing norms, introduces unconventional ideas, and is willing to take risks to achieve breakthrough results. In the context of business boundaries, this can mean pushing against traditional roles, hierarchies, or market limitations.\r\n\r\n## Potential Risks\r\n- **Cultural Resistance:** Established teams may resist change, leading to internal conflict or reduced morale.\r\n- **Process Disruption:** Standard operating procedures may be challenged, causing temporary inefficiencies.\r\n- **Reputational Impact:** Aggressive disruption can affect brand perception if not managed carefully.\r\n- **Compliance Issues:** Rebels may overlook regulatory or policy requirements in pursuit of innovation.\r\n\r\n## Potential Opportunities\r\n- **Innovation Acceleration:** New ideas and approaches can lead to competitive advantage.\r\n- **Market Expansion:** Challenging boundaries may open new markets or customer segments.\r\n- **Talent Attraction:** A culture that welcomes rebels can attract other creative thinkers.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- Infographic Placeholder: Risks vs. Opportunities -->\r\n<div class=\"infographic-placeholder\">\r\n  <strong>Infographic:</strong> Visual comparison of Potential Risks and Potential Opportunities of engaging disruptive rebels (e.g., split table or Venn diagram).\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Managing the Risk\r\n- **Set Clear Boundaries:** Define which areas are open to disruption and which are not.\r\n- **Foster Open Communication:** Encourage dialogue between rebels and traditionalists.\r\n- **Monitor Compliance:** Ensure that innovation does not come at the expense of legal or ethical standards.\r\n- **Align with Strategy:** Make sure disruptive efforts support overall business goals.\r\n\r\n## Key Traits of a Disruptive Rebel in Business\r\n\r\n### Bold\r\nDisruptive rebels are unafraid to challenge established norms and take decisive action. Their boldness can inspire teams to think bigger and move beyond incremental improvements, driving transformative change within the organization.\r\n\r\n### Tech-Savvy\r\nA disruptive rebel often leverages the latest technologies to create innovative solutions. Their comfort with digital tools and emerging tech trends enables them to identify new opportunities and implement cutting-edge strategies that keep the business ahead of the curve.\r\n\r\n### Risk-Tolerant\r\nThese individuals are willing to take calculated risks, understanding that failure is often a stepping stone to success. Their risk tolerance allows the organization to experiment, learn, and adapt quickly in a rapidly changing business environment.\r\n\r\n### Comprehensive\r\nA disruptive rebel takes a holistic view of challenges and opportunities. They consider the broader impact of their actions on the organization, market, and stakeholders, ensuring that innovation aligns with long-term strategic goals.\r\n\r\n### Analytic\r\nDespite their boldness, disruptive rebels rely on data and analysis to inform their decisions. They use metrics, research, and critical thinking to validate ideas and measure the impact of their initiatives, balancing intuition with evidence-based reasoning.\r\n\r\n### Collaborative\r\nWhile they may challenge the status quo, effective disruptive rebels know the value of collaboration. They build alliances across departments, encourage diverse perspectives, and foster a culture of open communication to ensure that innovation is sustainable and widely adopted.\r\n\r\n<!-- Infographic Placeholder: Key Traits of a Disruptive Rebel -->\r\n<div class=\"infographic-placeholder\">\r\n  <strong>Infographic:</strong> Icon-based grid or wheel showing Bold, Tech-Savvy, Risk-Tolerant, Comprehensive, Analytic, Collaborative, etc.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n### Why Agility Matters\r\nAgility enables disruptive rebels to quickly adapt to changing circumstances, seize new opportunities, and pivot strategies when needed. In a fast-paced business environment, this flexibility is crucial for staying ahead of competitors and responding to market shifts.\r\n\r\n### Streamlined\r\nDisruptive rebels often seek to simplify processes and eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy. By streamlining workflows, they help organizations become more efficient, responsive, and focused on delivering value.\r\n\r\n### Resourceful\r\nResourcefulness is a hallmark of disruptive rebels. They make the most of available assets, find creative solutions to obstacles, and turn constraints into opportunities for innovation and growth.\r\n\r\n### Sharp\r\nSharpness refers to keen insight and quick thinking. Disruptive rebels are able to assess situations rapidly, identify key issues, and make informed decisions that drive progress and positive change.\r\n\r\n### Best Practice: Leverage Tech for Efficiency\r\nDisruptive rebels maximize efficiency by adopting and integrating cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and advanced analytics. By staying at the forefront of tech innovation, they streamline operations, enhance decision-making, and unlock new business opportunities. Organizations should encourage the exploration and responsible use of emerging technologies to maintain a competitive edge and drive sustainable growth.\r\n\r\n### BEST PRACTICE: REDEFINE ROLES\r\nNo one can expect the job they have today to remain unchanged forever. Savvy organizations like the WMACs are responding by creating more flexible org charts and seeking out talent with more adaptable skills.\r\n\r\nMany best-in-class companies are replacing rigid job descriptions with job architectures that allow for quick and cost-effective adaptation when human capital needs change.\r\n\r\n> “Organizations are not necessarily hiring for fixed roles. They are looking at the work that needs to be done and the skills people need to do it,” says Manson-Smith.\r\n\r\nBecause of that, they can move people around more quickly as needs evolve. WMACs are also actively adjusting the skills and competencies they hire for, prioritizing skills like agility, curiosity, and the ability to learn and apply new things as much as, if not more than, experiences and education.\r\n\r\n> “They’re asking, ‘Can we count on you to be adaptable and agile in the way you operate?’” Royal explains. “It’s a much more forward-looking way of hiring.”\r\n\r\nAnd they’re extending that outlook to the professional development of existing employees as well.\r\n\r\n### HOW TO FAIL FAST\r\n\r\nThis year’s WMACs (World’s Most Admired Companies) are not only agile in capturing opportunities—they also bounce back quickly from failure. Even the most meticulously thought-through strategy will fall flat sometimes. It happens to everyone—including some of the largest and most admired companies in the world.\r\n\r\nWMACs tend to be culturally oriented to tolerate risk and failure. They recognize that when you are agile and curious, and you step outside of comfortable boundaries, you might not always get the result you want.\r\n\r\n> “WMACs are likely to view well-chosen risks that don’t pan out as learning opportunities.”  \r\n> — Mark Royal, Korn Ferry, Rebels with a Plan: Why the Best Companies are Disruptive\r\n\r\nHere are three tenets WMACs employ to fail faster:\r\n\r\n1. **Make it Safe**  \r\n   Unless there’s misconduct at play, there is no need to penalize people whose new projects don’t work out. “Experimenting means allowing people to fail sometimes,” says Manson-Smith.\r\n\r\n2. **Learn From It**  \r\n   Conduct a quick postmortem to better understand what went wrong. WMACs are likely to view well-chosen risks that don’t pan out as learning opportunities.\r\n\r\n3. **Move On**  \r\n   Don’t dwell on past missteps. In the words of Samuel Beckett, “Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”\r\n\r\n<!-- Infographic Placeholder: Fail Fast Cycle -->\r\n<div class=\"infographic-placeholder\">\r\n  <strong>Infographic:</strong> Cycle/process diagram for \"Make it Safe\", \"Learn From It\", \"Move On\" (Fail Fast Tenets).\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n### HOW TO BUILD A CHANGE-READY TEAM\r\nNo organization becomes change-ready overnight. It takes effort to prepare management and employee teams to manage transformation.\r\n\r\nOn this, WMACs are ahead of the pack. Their tactics vary but tend to complement the six transformational mindsets Korn Ferry has identified as helpful in developing change-ready organizations. We call it **ADAPTS**:\r\n\r\n- **A**\r\n- **D**\r\n- **A**\r\n- **P**\r\n- **T**\r\n- **S**\r\n\r\n#### The ADAPTS Model Explained\r\n\r\n- **Anticipate the Unexpected**  \r\n  Dispel workplace complacency and proactively look for early hints of changes to come.\r\n- **Diversity of Perspectives**  \r\n  Challenge established assumptions and seek alternative interpretations, driving innovation through diverse thinking.\r\n- **Anchor on Purpose**  \r\n  Assess new situations from the purpose lens, turning disruptions into opportunities.\r\n- **Progress over Perfection**  \r\n  Adopt an action-oriented approach, learning through doing and acting quickly to seize new opportunities rather than focusing solely on perfection.\r\n- **Trust to Partner**  \r\n  Rely on collective intelligence, bringing together knowledge, experience, and intuition from across the organization to respond to unexpected situations.\r\n- **Sustain the Organization**  \r\n  Demonstrate the ability to maintain operations while adapting to new challenges and changes.\r\n\r\n<!-- Infographic Placeholder: ADAPTS Model -->\r\n<div class=\"infographic-placeholder\">\r\n  <strong>Infographic:</strong> Acronym breakdown of ADAPTS with icons or stepper for each mindset.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n#### CHANGE AGENTS\r\nThe ability to lead or support change, along with learning agility and curiosity, are cited by WMAC executives as the most important criteria for success for people in their companies.\r\n\r\n### CHAMPIONS OF CHANGE\r\nWhen asked to reflect on how the changing workplace has impacted them personally, top responses among WMAC executives were:\r\n\r\n- “I feel positive about the impact our company is having and my role in it.”\r\n- “I am leading the change; there is no way back.”\r\n- “I feel energized about developing others in the company.”\r\n\r\nThese champions of change are not only adapting to transformation but are also inspiring and empowering those around them to embrace new opportunities and drive the organization forward.\r\n\r\n### GUT-CHECK: ARE YOU READY?\r\nDisruptive organizations need disruptive leadership. As you prepare to steer your organization towards a more innovative, agile, and change-ready future, experts recommend asking yourself three key questions:\r\n\r\n**Q1. Am I stuck in the success trap?**  \r\n“WMAC leaders are not captive to past success,” Royal explains. “They show a willingness to adapt and adjust despite past track records that might encourage them to just stay the course. They don’t assume what worked in the past will work in the future.”\r\n\r\n**Q2. Am I connecting the dots?**  \r\n“The best leaders look across all dimensions of what drives organizational performance, and they consider it all together,” says Manson-Smith. “They have a very clear growth strategy, and they really focus on aligning the whole organization to support it.”\r\n\r\n**Q3. Am I a team player?**  \r\n“Collaboration runs through a lot of what is involved in disruption,” says Royal. “Leaders have to think with an enterprise mindset about opportunities and challenges. That means asking, ‘Am I really as connected and collaborative as I can be to help the organization thrive?’”\r\n\r\n<!-- Infographic Placeholder: GUT-CHECK Self-Assessment -->\r\n<div class=\"infographic-placeholder\">\r\n  <strong>Infographic:</strong> Checklist or decision tree for the three GUT-CHECK leadership questions.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n### GAIN MORE INSIGHT\r\nIt takes effort to build organizations that can disrupt progressively, quickly, and effectively. And change is never easy. But the formidable performance of this year’s WMACs can’t be discounted.\r\n\r\nTo rise above the competition, it’s clear that organizations need to focus on innovation, agility, and change readiness. In 2025, disruption is simply smart.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Fortune and Korn Ferry Reveal the 2025 World’s Most Admired Companies List\r\n\r\nApple returns as No. 1 on the 27th version of the annual Top 50 All-Stars’ List.

It emphasizes the importance of detailed, multidimensional modeling to ensure accurate representations of dependencies and correlations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEngaging a disruptive rebel can be a catalyst for growth, but requires careful management to balance risk and reward. Organizations should plan for both the challenges and the opportunities that such engagement brings.\r\n\r\nDisruptive Rebel Risk\r\n**Nature of Risk:** This risk emerges when unconventional thinkers or challengers of the status quo push boundaries within an organization or market. While their disruption can lead to innovation, it can also introduce volatility, unpredictability, and resistance within established frameworks.\r\n\r\n**Key Characteristics:**\r\n\r\nStrategic Volatility: Rapid shifts in operational, financial, or structural dynamics due to unconventional decision-making.\r\n\r\nRegulatory and Compliance Uncertainty: Potential misalignment with existing legal frameworks or industry standards.\r\n\r\nCultural Friction and Resistance: Internal conflicts stemming from disruptive approaches that challenge traditional leadership or workflows.\r\n\r\nMarket Influence Risks: Sudden, unforeseen impacts on competitive positioning due to aggressive or unconventional strategies.\r\n\r\nSystemic Ripple Effects: Amplification of risks when the Disruptive Rebel's influence extends across interconnected business ecosystems.\r\n\r\n**Modeling Disruptive Rebel Risk**\r\nUnderstanding dependencies and correlations:\r\n\r\nCross-Impact Analysis: Mapping the connections between disruptive decision-making and systemic effects.\r\n\r\nBehavioral Risk Models: Incorporating psychological and strategic behavior trends to predict nonlinear impacts.\r\n\r\nAgent-Based Simulation: Modeling market responses and internal reactions to disruptive events.\r\n\r\n**Accountability and Risk Management**\r\nStructured Adaptation: Implementing adaptive frameworks to harness disruption while mitigating volatility.\r\n\r\nGuardrail Mechanisms: Designing resilience measures, such as dynamic policies and risk buffers, to contain extreme behaviors.\r\n\r\nStress Testing for Unconventional Scenarios: Simulating disruptive strategies to assess their long-term implications on operational, financial, and reputational health.\r\n\r\nThe Disruptive Rebel introduces a risk-reward dynamic that must be carefully managed. Organizations benefit when they embrace disruptive thinking but remain strategically prepared to counteract unforeseen consequences.",
