# Project Charter  
**Project Title:**  
Next.js Portfolio with RAG Chatbot and Automated Requirements Utilities

**Project Start Date:**  
[To be filled]

**Projected Finish Date:**  
[To be filled]

**Version:**  
1.0

## 1. Project Purpose and Business Justification

The purpose of this project is to design, develop, and deploy a modern, interactive, and content-rich developer portfolio powered by Next.js. The portfolio will showcase technical skills, projects, and blogs, and feature an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot leveraging Google Gemini. Automated requirements gathering scripts and robust utility modules will streamline ongoing documentation and requirements management. This solution enables developers to demonstrate their capabilities interactively, while enabling employers, collaborators, and administrators to efficiently evaluate, interact, and manage portfolio content.

**Business Justification:**  
- Increases developer visibility and employability through real-time, interactive content presentation.
- Provides employers/recruiters with actionable insights and evidence of developer skills via AI-powered analytics and chatbot Q&A.
- Enhances portfolio maintainability and quality with automation and rigorous branch protection.
- Supports platform scalability and collaboration with robust, secure, and well-documented infrastructure.

## 2. Measurable Project Objectives

- Deliver a fully functional Next.js-based portfolio site with RAG chatbot by [date].
- Achieve 100% passing rate on 88+ automated unit/integration tests for core utilities and chatbot functionality.
- Enable chatbot to correctly answer >90% of portfolio-related queries with source attribution and similarity scoring.
- Automate requirements documentation updates with <1 hour manual intervention per update cycle.
- Implement GitHub branch protection such that direct pushes to `master` are blocked and all merges require CI checks and code review.
- Ensure platform can support at least 100 concurrent users with <2s average response time.

---

## 3. High-Level Requirements

- Portfolio site built using Next.js (`create-next-app`), supporting easy content editing and hot-reloading.
- Integration with Google Gemini via Vertex AI APIs for RAG chatbot functionality.
- Environment configuration via `.env.local` for secure API credentials and toggling of mock/development modes.
- Support for content extraction, analytics, and real-time data visualization.
- Automated requirements gathering and documentation update scripts (`auto-requirements.js`), using robust utility modules with full test coverage.
- Role-based features for Developers, Employers, Collaborators, Administrators, and Content Curators as per requirements-agent output.
- GitHub branch protection enforcing PR reviews, CI status checks, and administrator inclusion (see [Branch Protection Setup](#)).
- Responsive UI with optimized fonts and accessibility compliance.
- CI/CD integration for automated testing, linting, and deployments (e.g., with Vercel).

## 4. High-Level Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

- Google Gemini and Vertex AI APIs will remain available and stable for project duration.
- Developers and collaborators have access to necessary credentials and permissions.
- Portfolio content (projects, blogs) will be provided and updated regularly.
- All utility scripts and modules will be compatible with the selected Node.js/Next.js versions.
- Third-party services (e.g., Vercel, GitHub) will not introduce breaking changes during project timeline.

### Constraints

- Must comply with GitHub repository governance (branch protection, code reviews, CI/CD).
- All dependencies must be open-source or appropriately licensed.
- Portfolio must use Next.js as the core framework; significant architectural deviations are not permitted.
- Project must be delivered within [X] weeks/months from authorization.
- API usage costs for Google Vertex AI must be monitored and kept within the approved budget.
