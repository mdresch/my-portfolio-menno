## 4. Activity Sequence and Logical Relationships

- **A1** → **A2, A3, A4** (project kickoff must precede environment setup, branch protection, and requirements finalization)
- **A2** → **A5, A6, A8, A9, A10, A11** (environment must be ready before dev activities)
- **A3** → **A12** (branch protection before CI/CD enforcement)
- **A4** → **A5, A6, A7, A9, A10** (requirements finalization before related implementation)
- **A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10** → **A11** (all features must be implemented before full test suite)
- **A11** → **A12** (tests must exist before CI/CD enforcement)
- **A12** → **A13** (CI/CD must validate before UAT)
- **A13** → **A14** (UAT signoff before deployment)
- **A14** → **A15** (monitoring/support after go-live)

## 5. Network Diagram Logic and Dependencies

Below is a simplified activity-on-node (AON) logic:

```
A1

 | A2
 |  |\
 |  | A5
 |  |  |
 |  |  A6
 |  |  |
 |  |  A7
 |  |  |
 |  |  A8

 |  |  |
 |  |  A13
 |  |  |
 |  |  A14
 |  |  |
 |  |  A15
 |  |
A3--|
A4--| (A4 must finish before A5, A6, A7, A9, A10)
```
- Parallel branches for A2 (env setup), A3 (branch protection), and A4 (requirements).
- All development flows from A
