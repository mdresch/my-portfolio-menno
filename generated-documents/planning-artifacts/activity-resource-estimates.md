## 3. Resource Calendars & Availability Constraints

- **Developers:**  
  - Standard 40-hour work weeks; time off tracked via HR system.
  - Key dependencies (AI/ML Engineer, DevOps) may be allocated on multiple projects—confirm availability at least 2 weeks in advance.
- **External Vendors (GCP):**
  - API quotas subject to Google Cloud billing status and region availability.
  - GCP scheduled maintenance may impact access.
- **Testing/QA:**
  - Test resources required at integration and pre-launch; align with feature freeze dates.
- **Administrative Support:**
  - Platform admins and content curators may be fractional or ad hoc.

*Resource calendar should be maintained in your project management tool (e.g., Jira, MS Project) and updated weekly.*

## 5. Resource Optimization Strategies & Alternatives

- **Cross-Training:**  
  Developers with Next.js and backend skills can share AI integration and script automation tasks to reduce bottlenecks.
- **Mock AI Integration:**  
  Use the mock Gemini API for development/testing to avoid GCP costs and quota exhaustion.
- **Parallelization:**  
  UI/UX design and backend scripting can proceed in parallel with AI API setup.
- **Automated Testing:**  
  Leverage existing unit/integration tests to minimize manual QA effort.
- **Vendor Utilization:**  
  Use Vercel and Google-managed services to minimize
