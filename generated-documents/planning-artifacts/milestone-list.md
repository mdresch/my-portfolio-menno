# Milestone List: Next.js Portfolio with RAG Chatbot and Automation

| # | Milestone Name | Description & Success Criteria | Target Date | Dependencies | Responsible Parties / Stakeholders | Risk Factors & Mitigation | Impact on Project Timeline |
|---|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | **Project Kickoff & Team Formation** | Project officially started; all key roles assigned and onboarding complete. Clear R&R documented. | T+0 | None | Project Sponsor, Project Manager, All Team Members | Resource unavailability; Mitigation: Early scheduling, backup candidates | Project cannot proceed without team formation |
| 2 | **Requirements Elicitation & Validation** | All business, user, and system requirements gathered, reviewed, and baseline approved (see requirements-agent-output). | T+2 weeks | Milestone 1 | Project Manager, Business Analyst, Key Stakeholders (Dev, Employer, Admin, Curator) | Incomplete requirements; Mitigation: Workshops, early stakeholder engagement | Delays affect scope, design, and development |
| 3 | **Architecture & Technology Stack Finalization** | System architecture, tech stack (Next.js, Google Gemini API, test/lint/build workflows) and integration approach documented and approved. | T+3 weeks | Milestone 2 | Technical Lead, Dev Team, Sponsor | Tech risk (API limits, stack mismatch); Mitigation: PoC, vendor consultation | Foundation for all technical work |
| 4 | **Resource Procurement & External Dependencies Setup** | All necessary cloud services (Google Cloud, Vercel), credentials, and vendor APIs are provisioned and validated for access. | T+4 weeks | Milestone 3 | IT Admin, Vendor Liaisons, PM | Vendor delays; Mitigation: Early engagement, alternate providers | Delays here block system integration |
| 5 | **Development Environment & Branch Protection Established** | Local/dev environments ready (npm, Next.js, .env), branch protection rules configured (per BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP), CI/CD pipelines established and tested. | T+5 weeks | Milestone 4 | DevOps, Developers, QA | CI/CD setup errors; Mitigation: Use templates, pair reviews | Ensures dev quality and workflow discipline |
| 6 | **Core Portfolio & Content Management Functionality Complete (Phase Gate 1)** | CRUD for projects/blogs, authentication, user roles, content workflows deployed to dev with unit tests passing (see process-flows). | T+7 weeks | Milestone 5 | Developers, QA, Product Owner | Feature creep; Mitigation: Scope lock, sprint reviews | Key for subsequent chatbot integration |
| 7 | **Automated Requirements & Utilities Delivered** | scripts/auto-requirements.js and utils.js implemented, passing all unit tests; documentation complete. | T+8 weeks | Milestone 6 | Developers, QA | Test failures; Mitigation: Test-driven development, code reviews | Enables requirements traceability and maintenance |
| 8 | **RAG Chatbot (Google Gemini) Integration Complete (Phase Gate 2)** | RAG chatbot functional in dev: real portfolio content retrieval, Gemini API (and mock fallback) fully integrated, passing feature tests. | T+10 weeks | Milestones 6, 7 | Developers, AI Lead, QA | API quota/latency; Mitigation: Mock fallback, monitoring | Major project differentiator—must pass gate review |
| 9 | **Vendor & Compliance Review** | Cloud service use, data handling, and chatbot API integration reviewed for compliance (security, privacy, regulatory). All required approvals obtained. | T+11 weeks | Milestone 8 | IT Security, Legal, PM | Regulatory gap; Mitigation: Early legal review, vendor documentation | Required for production launch |
| 10 | **System Integration Testing (SIT) & QA Signoff** | All features tested together (portfolio, chatbot, automation, analytics). No critical/blocker defects; SIT exit criteria met. | T+12 weeks | Milestones 8, 9 | QA Lead, Developers | Integration bugs; Mitigation: Test plans, bug triage, extra SIT cycle | Quality gate for UAT and deployment |
| 11 | **Customer Review & User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** | Customer/stakeholder walkthroughs, UAT scenarios executed, all critical user feedback addressed. Formal UAT signoff obtained. | T+13 weeks | Milestone 10 | Project Sponsor, Product Owner, Key Users | UAT failure; Mitigation: Buffer for rework, early demos | Must pass for go-live approval |
| 12 | **Go/No-Go & Deployment Planning (Phase Gate 3)** | Final go/no-go meeting held; deployment plan and rollback steps approved; communications to users scheduled. | T+13.5 weeks | Milestone 11 | PM, DevOps, Sponsor | Late showstoppers; Mitigation: Checklists, readiness reviews | Go-live cannot proceed without this |
| 13 | **Production Deployment & Verification** | System deployed to Vercel, endpoints and integrations validated, smoke tests pass. | T+14 weeks | Milestone 12 | DevOps, QA, Developers | Outages; Mitigation: Rollback plan, deployment window | Marks project handover to operations |
| 14 | **Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plan Execution (as needed)** | All high-impact risks tracked; contingency plans executed if any major issue occurs (e.g., API outage, security breach). | Ongoing | All prior milestones | PM, All Team Members | Unforeseen events; Mitigation: Active risk log, incident response | Prevents schedule/cost overruns |
| 15 | **Post-Go-Live Support, Knowledge Transfer & Project Closure** | Knowledge transfer to operations/maintenance team, documentation delivered, final stakeholder review. Project signoff and closure report. | T+15 weeks | Milestone 13 | PM, DevOps, Sponsor, Stakeholders | Incomplete KT; Mitigation: Closure checklist, training sessions | Formal project completion and transition |

## Notes on PMBOK Alignment

- **Each milestone is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)**
- **Success criteria** are clearly defined for each milestone.
- **Dependencies** ensure logical sequencing and phase gate reviews.
- **Responsible parties** are named for accountability.
- **Risks** are identified per milestone, with mitigation strategies.
- **Impact** statement clarifies each milestone’s role in schedule management and project flow.
- **External dependencies** (e.g., Google Cloud, Vercel, regulatory approval) and **vendor milestones** are explicitly included.
- **Quality gates** (SIT, UAT, go/no-go) provide checkpoints for stakeholder alignment and risk management.
- **Resource allocation** is addressed at kickoff, with re-evaluation as needed at each phase.
- **Communication** milestones are woven into deployment planning and closure.
