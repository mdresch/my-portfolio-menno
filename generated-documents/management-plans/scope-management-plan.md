# Scope Management Plan  
**Project:** Next.js Portfolio with RAG Chatbot and Requirements Automation  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Prepared by:** [Project Manager Name]  

---

## 1. Purpose

This Scope Management Plan defines how the project scope will be defined, validated, and controlled for the Next.js Portfolio with RAG Chatbot project. It ensures that all work required—and only the work required—to complete the project successfully is included, aligning with PMBOK 7th Edition principles.

---

## 2. Scope Management Approach

- The Project Manager (PM) is accountable for scope management and will work with stakeholders, including developers, recruiters, collaborators, administrators, and content curators.
- The PM will ensure project scope is formally approved, communicated, and controlled throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## 3. Scope Definition

### 3.1 Collect Requirements

Requirements will be gathered from:
- Stakeholder interviews (developers, recruiters, collaborators, admins, curators)
- Automated requirements scripts (e.g., `auto-requirements.js`)
- Existing documentation (`requirements-agent-output.md`, process flows)
- Regulatory, security, and technical standards (e.g., branch protection)

### 3.2 Project Scope Statement

**Project Objectives:**  
To deliver a developer portfolio platform built on Next.js that includes:  
- A RAG chatbot powered by Google Gemini for content-grounded Q&A  
- Automated requirements gathering and documentation utilities  
- Portfolio content management, analytics, and collaboration features  
- Branch protection and CI/CD for quality assurance  
- Role-based access and content curation functions

**In Scope:**  
- Next.js-based portfolio app, including setup and deployment  
- Integration with Google Gemini for RAG chatbot  
- Automated requirements scripts and utilities  
- Portfolio content CRUD (projects, blogs, media)  
- Role-based access and admin/curator features  
- Analytics dashboards and data visualization  
- Branch protection setup and CI/CD  
- Unit and integration testing as per `TEST_SUMMARY.md`  
- Documentation (user, admin, process, and technical)

**Out of Scope:**  
- Mobile app development  
- Marketing site (other than portfolio)  
- Third-party hosting outside Vercel  
- Non-Gemini AI models

## 4. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

### 4.1 Creation and Definition

- WBS will be created collaboratively using stakeholder input and requirements documentation.
- WBS will be hierarchical, decomposing deliverables to work package level.

**Level 1:** Portfolio Platform  
**Level 2:**  
1. Project Setup  
   - Next.js Initialization  
   - Repository configuration  
2. Chatbot Development  
   - Gemini API integration  
   - RAG content extraction and indexing  
   - UI/UX for chatbot  
   - Mock implementation  
3. Content Management  
   - Project/blog CRUD  
   - Media management  
   - External integration (GitHub, analytics)  
4. Role & Access Management  
   - Authentication/Authorization  
   - Admin tools  
   - Curator features  
5. Analytics & Reporting  
   - Data visualization dashboards  
   - Engagement tracking  
6. Automation & Utilities  
   - Requirements agent scripts  
   - Utility modules (`utils.js`)  
   - Testing (`TEST_SUMMARY.md`)  
7. Quality Assurance  
   - CI/CD workflows  
   - Branch protection  
   - Testing & linting  
8. Documentation  
   - User/Admin guides  
   - Technical/process docs

### 4.2 WBS Dictionary

- Each WBS element will have a dictionary entry specifying:
  - Unique ID
  - Description
  - Deliverables
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Responsible party
  - Dependencies
- The WBS dictionary will be kept in a shared repository (e.g., `/docs/wbs-dictionary.md`) and updated during planning and change control.

---

## 5. Scope Validation

- **Process:**  
  - Upon completion of each deliverable, the PM will organize review sessions with stakeholders.
  - Deliverables will be verified against the WBS dictionary acceptance criteria.
  - Formal sign-off (physical or digital) will be required from designated stakeholders (e.g., Product Owner, Admin).
- **Documentation:**  
  - Acceptance forms and meeting notes will be stored in the project documentation repository.

---

## 6. Scope Control

- **Change Control Process:**  
  - All scope change requests must be submitted via a Change Request Form.
  - Requests are logged, analyzed by the PM, and assessed for impact (schedule, cost, quality, risk).
  - Changes are reviewed and approved/rejected by the Change Control Board (CCB), consisting of the PM, product owner, and key stakeholders.
  - Approved changes are communicated to the team, and scope baseline and WBS are updated accordingly.
- **Scope Creep Prevention:**  
  - The PM will monitor work against the scope baseline and address unauthorized changes.
  - Regular scope reviews during status meetings.

---

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Project Manager:** Leads scope management, maintains WBS, oversees change control.
- **Product Owner:** Approves scope statement and changes, validates deliverables.
- **Developers/Contributors:** Deliver work as per WBS, report scope issues.
- **Administrators/Curators:** Review features relevant to their roles.
- **Stakeholders:** Provide input to requirements and validation.

---

## 8. Tools and Documentation

- **Requirements Tracking:** Managed in `/docs/requirements/requirements-agent-output.md` and tracked via issues.
- **WBS & Dictionary:** `/docs/wbs.md`, `/docs/wbs-dictionary.md`
- **Change Requests:** `/docs/change-requests/`
- **Acceptance Forms:** `/docs/acceptance-forms/`
- **Meetings and Reviews:** Recorded in `/docs/meetings/`

---

## 9. Alignment with Project Charter

- All scope elements and processes adhere to the objectives, constraints, and deliverables defined in the project charter.
- Deviations from the charter require formal change approval.
