## 4. Information Distribution and Access Procedures

- **Central Repository**: All project documentation, code, and requirements are stored in GitHub (private or protected as necessary).
- **Access Control**: Managed via GitHub permissions; roles (admin, developer, curator, etc.) determine access level.
- **Documentation**: Markdown files stored in `/docs` directory and Wiki; version-controlled.
- **Automated Notifications**: Set up via GitHub Actions and Slack integrations for PRs, CI/CD, and incidents.
- **Meeting Notes**: Stored as Markdown in `/docs/meetings` with date-based filenames for traceability.
- **Sensitive Data**: Environment variables and credentials managed in `.env.local`, not committed to source control. Distribution via secure channels only.
