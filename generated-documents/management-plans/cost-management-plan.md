**Project Name:** Next.js Portfolio with RAG Chatbot and Automated Requirements  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Prepared by:** [Project Manager Name]

## 1. Introduction

This Cost Management Plan defines the processes, tools, and methodologies for planning, estimating, budgeting, managing, controlling, and reporting project costs for the Next.js Portfolio project. This plan aligns with PMBOK 7th Edition standards and is tailored to the specific context and requirements of the project.

## 2. Cost Estimation Methodology and Tools

**2.1 Methodology:**  
- **Bottom-up Estimating:** Decompose the project into work packages (e.g., UI, RAG Chatbot, automated requirements scripts, testing, deployment, etc.), estimate costs at the lowest level, then aggregate.
- **Analogous Estimating:** Use historical data from similar projects to validate estimates.
- **Parametric Estimating:** For repeatable tasks (e.g., per-hour developer rates, per-API call costs).
- **Expert Judgment:** Leverage SME input for unique integrations (e.g., Gemini API, Vercel deployment).

**2.2 Tools:**  
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Decompose project scope for granular estimation.
- **Spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets):** For estimate aggregation and analysis.
- **Project Management Software (Jira, Trello, or MS Project):** For cost tracking and integration with schedule/resource plans.
- **APIs/Cloud Cost Calculators:** For estimating cloud and AI service usage expenses.

## 3. Cost Budgeting and Baseline Development

- **Budget Aggregation:** All cost estimates will be rolled up from WBS work packages to form the total project budget.
- **Cost Baseline:** The sum of estimated costs plus contingency reserve, authorized by management, will be established as the cost baseline.
- **Baseline Components:**
  - **Direct Labor (Dev, QA, PM):** Based on estimated hours and rates.
  - **Cloud Services:** Vercel, Google Vertex AI (Gemini API), storage, etc.
  - **Licenses/Subscriptions:** Any required for development or deployment.
  - **Testing & QA:** Automated and manual testing efforts.
  - **Contingency Reserve:** As determined by risk analysis.
  - **Management Reserve:** For unforeseen scope changes outside contingency.

- **Budget Tracking:** The cost baseline will serve as the reference for all cost performance tracking.

## 4. Cost Control Procedures and Variance Analysis

**4.1 Cost Control Procedures:**  
- **Monthly (or Sprint-based) Review:** Actual costs recorded and compared to planned values.
- **Variance Analysis:**  
  - **Cost Variance (CV):** CV = EV - AC (Earned Value - Actual Cost)
  - **Schedule Variance (SV):** SV = EV - PV (Earned Value - Planned Value)
  - **Cost Performance Index (CPI):** CPI = EV / AC
  - **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** SPI = EV / PV

- **Thresholds:** Variances >10% from baseline trigger corrective action and formal change management.
- **Forecasting:** Regular updates of Estimate at Completion (EAC) and Estimate to Complete (ETC).

---

## 5. Earned Value Management (EVM) Implementation

- **EVM Metrics:**  
  - **Planned Value (PV):** Budgeted cost of scheduled work.
  - **Earned Value (EV):** Budgeted cost of performed work.
  - **Actual Cost (AC):** Actual cost incurred for work performed.

- **Measurement Frequency:** Bi-weekly for agile sprints, or monthly for waterfall phases.
- **Integration:** EVM data integrated with schedule and resource plans for holistic project performance.

---

## 6. Cost Reporting and Performance Measurement

- **Cost Reports:**  
  - **Frequency:** Weekly summary, monthly detailed.
  - **Audience:** Project team, sponsors, key stakeholders.
  - **Content:** Actuals vs. budget, EVM metrics, trend analysis, forecast updates, and variance explanations.

- **Dashboards:** Real-time dashboards via project management tools for transparency.
- **Documentation:** All reports archived in project repository for audit trail.

---

## 7. Change Control Procedures for Cost Baseline

- **Change Requests:** All changes impacting the cost baseline require formal change requests.
- **Impact Assessment:** Each change request is analyzed for cost, schedule, and scope impacts.
- **Approval Process:** Change Control Board (CCB) reviews and approves/rejects requests.
- **Baseline Updates:** Approved changes documented and baseline updated; stakeholders notified.

---

## 8. Funding Requirements and Cash Flow Analysis

- **Funding Schedule:**  
  - Defined by project phase/milestone (e.g., Design, Dev, Testing, Deployment).
  - Cash flow forecasted to ensure funds are available before work starts.

- **Cash Flow Tracking:**  
  - Monthly cash flow statements.
  - Highlight periods of peak spend (e.g., during AI integration, deployment).

- **Funding Constraints:**  
  - Monitor for funding gaps; escalate to sponsor if risks to cash flow arise.

---

## 9. Cost Contingency and Risk Management

- **Contingency Reserve:**  
  - Calculated based on risk assessment (e.g., 10â€“15% of baseline for identified technical risks, AI service cost fluctuations).

- **Risk Register:**  
  - All cost-related risks (e.g., API cost spikes, delayed integration) logged, monitored, and mitigated.

- **Trigger Events:**  
  - Defined for when contingency funds are accessed (e.g., unexpected service charges, urgent fixes).

- **Risk
