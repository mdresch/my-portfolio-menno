## 1. **Quality Objectives, Standards, and Metrics**

### 1.1 Quality Objectives
- Deliver a robust, secure, and performant portfolio web application.
- Ensure chatbot responses are accurate, content-grounded, and source-attributed.
- Automate requirements gathering and documentation updates with minimal errors.
- Achieve high code maintainability and test coverage.
- Facilitate seamless user experience for all roles (Developer, Employer, Collaborator, Admin, Curator).

### 1.2 Quality Standards
- **Code:** Follows JavaScript/TypeScript best practices, Next.js/Vercel guidelines, and ESLint style rules.
- **Testing:** All critical functions are unit and integration tested; minimum 90% code coverage.
- **Security:** Follows OWASP Top 10 for web applications; environment variables managed securely.
- **Documentation:** Up-to-date, clear, and accessible, including API, user guides, and process flows.
- **Branch Protection:** Enforced as per [Branch Protection Setup](docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md).
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for user-facing features.

## 3. **Quality Control Processes and Checkpoints**

- **Branch Protection:** All code merged to master must pass tests, linting, and build status checks.
- **Pull Request Template:** Enforces description of changes, test plan, and impact analysis.
- **Pre-merge Checklist:** Includes code review, test results, and documentation update confirmation.
- **Release Checkpoint:** Final regression and smoke testing, accessibility validation, and stakeholder approval.
- **Automated Requirements Sync:** Validates that updates from scripts/auto-requirements.js are reflected in documentation.

---

## 4. **Testing Strategies and Acceptance Criteria**

### 4.1 Testing Strategies
- **Unit Testing:** scripts/utils.js and all business logic, with Jest.
- **Integration Testing:** Chatbot flows, API integration, and content extraction.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Main user journeys (Next.js pages, chat interactions) using Cypress/Playwright.
- **Mock Testing:** Gemini API responses in development mode.
- **Manual UAT:** Stakeholder sign-off on critical features and user flows.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Automated (axe-core, Lighthouse) and manual checks.

### 4.2 Acceptance Criteria
- All test suites pass with no critical or high severity issues.
- All requirements from requirements-agent-output.md are demonstrably implemented.
- All user roles can complete primary workflows without error.
- Documentation, including process flows and usage, is current and accessible.
- RAG chatbot provides content-grounded, source-attributed answers with fallback to mock as needed.

## 5. **Quality Improvement Processes and Continuous Improvement**

- **Retrospectives:** After each sprint/release, review quality issues, gather lessons learned.
- **Defect Root Cause Analysis:** Identify and address root causes of recurring defects.
- **Metrics Review:** Regularly analyze test coverage, bug rates, and user feedback.
- **Process Refinement:** Update CI/CD pipelines, review processes, and documentation standards.
- **Feedback Channels:** Encourage stakeholder and user feedback for continuous product quality enhancement.
