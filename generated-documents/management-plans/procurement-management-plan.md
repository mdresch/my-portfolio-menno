## 1. Make-or-Buy Analysis and Procurement Decisions

**Objective:**  
Determine which project components will be developed in-house vs. procured from external vendors.

**Analysis:**

| Component                                   | In-House | Procure | Rationale                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Next.js application core                     | X        |         | Leverages internal dev skills; core business value.                                            |
| Google Vertex AI/Gemini API access           |          | X       | Specialized ML API; cannot be built internally.                                                |
| Automated requirements & utilities scripts   | X        |         | Tailored to project needs; internal expertise available.                                       |
| Cloud hosting (Vercel)                       |          | X       | Managed service; cost-effective vs. custom hosting.                                            |
| Fonts (Geist via next/font)                  |          | X       | Third-party font; provided by Vercel.                                                          |
| Branch protection and CI/CD (GitHub Actions) |          | X       | Managed version control and automation; standard industry practice.                            |
| Content extraction/analytics tools           | X        |         | Custom for project; internal development aligns with requirements.                             |
| Media storage (cloud, if needed)             |          | X       | If content/media scale, cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) may be required for reliability/scalability. |

**Procurement Decisions:**
- **Buy**: Google Cloud APIs (Vertex AI, Gemini), Vercel hosting, Geist font, GitHub Actions, possibly cloud storage.
- **Make**: Application code, requirements automation, utilities, custom analytics, and content management.

---

## 2. Procurement Strategy and Approach

**Strategy:**
- Use **direct purchase/subscription** for cloud services (Google Cloud, Vercel, GitHub).
- Use **open-source/free resources** where available (e.g., Geist font).
- Establish **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** for all critical external services.
- Ensure licensing/compliance reviews for all third-party tools and APIs.

**Approach:**
- Establish vendor accounts (Google, Vercel, GitHub).
- Negotiate pricing for any non-free tiers based on forecasted usage.
- Leverage existing procurement processes for cloud and SaaS.
- Integrate billing/usage monitoring for cost control.

---

## 3. Contract Types and Procurement Methods

**Contract Types:**
- **Cloud APIs/Hosting**: Subscription or pay-as-you-go (unit-based pricing).
- **Fonts/Open-source**: License agreements (e.g., MIT, commercial font licenses).
- **CI/CD**: Free tier or paid subscription (GitHub Actions).

**Procurement Methods:**
- **Direct purchase/subscription** via vendor portals.
- **Acceptance of license terms** for open-source or free resources.
- **Enterprise agreements** if required by organization scale.

---

## 4. Vendor Selection Criteria and Evaluation Processes

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Technical Fit**: Compatibility with Next.js and project requirements.
- **Reliability/Uptime**: SLAs, redundancy, and support.
- **Cost**: Transparent, scalable, aligns with project budget.
- **Security & Compliance**: Meets data privacy, security, and compliance needs.
- **Support**: Quality of vendor support, documentation, and community.

**Evaluation Process:**
1. **Requirements Definition**: Define technical and business requirements.
2. **Market Research**: Identify potential vendors and solutions.
3. **Shortlisting**: Select top candidates based on criteria.
4. **Proof of Concept/Trial**: Test integration with project (APIs, hosting, etc.).
5. **Reference Checks**: Review case studies, testimonials, and SLA history.
6. **Decision & Approval**: Select vendor and obtain internal approval.

---

## 5. Contract Management and Administration Procedures

**Procedures:**
- Assign a **Procurement Manager** (project lead or designated PM).
- Maintain a **central contract repository** (digital storage, e.g., SharePoint, Google Drive).
- Track **key contract milestones**, renewal dates, and SLAs.
- Monitor **vendor performance** through regular reviews and metric tracking.
- Manage **invoices and payments** according to established financial processes.
- Define **escalation paths** for contract disputes or breaches.

---

## 6. Risk Management for Procurement Activities

**Procurement Risks:**
- Vendor lock-in (e.g., reliance on Google Gemini).
- Service outages or API changes impacting project functionality.
- Cost escalation due to increased API usage or hosting needs.
- Data privacy or regulatory non-compliance.
- Vendor support unavailability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Select vendors with strong SLAs and reputations.
- Design application with **fallback/mocking** (already present for Gemini).
- Monitor usage and set alerts for cost overruns.
- Regular compliance reviews for third-party services.
- Maintain up-to-date documentation for vendor APIs.

**Risk Register:**  
Maintain a risk register with owner, likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategy for each procurement-related risk.

## 7. Procurement Performance Measurement and Control

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- **Service Uptime**: % uptime for APIs and hosting.
- **Response Times**: API and support response.
- **Cost Variance**: Actual vs. planned procurement costs.
- **Compliance Adherence**: Zero violations of licensing, data privacy, or contractual terms.
