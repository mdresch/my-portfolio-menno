### Project Summary

The "personal-website" project is a next-generation developer portfolio platform built with Next.js and a robust ASP.NET Core backend. It uniquely integrates advanced AI capabilities—specifically a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot powered by Google Gemini—to provide dynamic, context-aware responses to user inquiries about the portfolio’s projects, blog content, and demonstrated skills.

The system is engineered for high interactivity, personalization, and data-driven insights. It features real-time analytics, content-source attribution, similarity scoring for returned results, and a development/test mode for the AI chatbot. The platform supports seamless integration with coding activity trackers, external repositories, and analytics tools, while maintaining enterprise-grade security, content moderation, and administrative controls.
