### 4. Source Attribution and Similarity Score Display

**User Story 4.1:**  
As a **Visitor**, I want to see which content sources the RAG chatbot used to generate an answer, along with relevance scores, so I can verify information accuracy.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Each chatbot answer lists the content source(s) with title and link.
  - Similarity score for each source is displayed (e.g., as a percentage or bar).
  - Sources are ordered by relevance.

- **Priority:** Medium  
- **Story Points:** 5  
- **Dependencies:** RAG Chatbot (3.1)  
- **Edge Cases/Error Scenarios:**
  - No sources found: graceful message to user.

### 5. Mock Mode and Fallback Handling

**User Story 5.1:**  
As a **Developer**, I want the chatbot to automatically use a mock implementation when in development mode or when the Gemini API is down, so that I can test safely and avoid API usage costs.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - In `NODE_ENV=development` or `USE_MOCK_GEMINI=true`, chatbot uses mock responses.
  - UI displays a visible notice: “Mock Mode: responses are simulated.”
  - If the live Gemini API fails, system switches to mock mode with notification.
  - All chatbot features (history, source attribution, etc.) are available in mock mode.

- **Priority:** High  
- **Story Points:** 5  
- **Dependencies:** RAG Chatbot (3.1)  
- **Edge Cases/Error Scenarios:**
  - Mid-conversation API failure: mock mode resumes seamlessly, with user informed.
  - Mock data is outdated: developers can update or reset mock data easily.
