# ✅ RPAS‑CM Amendment Record: AMD‑2026‑04‑13‑0003

## 1. Metadata
- **Type**: INT / UI (Improvement)
- **Status**: Certified
- **Version Impact**: v2.4.1 (CSR-43)
- **Reference Commit**: 4ed3ac76
- **Governance Gate**: DRACO-Optimized + Operator-Manual Aligned

## 2. Change Description
This amendment formalizes the **Governor Portal Cockpit Redesign** and the integration of **Operational Principles (G5.2)** into the ADPA framework.

### Core Objectives:
1. **G5.2: Boundary Enforcement Transparency**: The UI must explicitly distinguish between the **Intelligence Tier** (Advisory) and the **Orchestrator Tier** (Authority) to prevent accidental bypass of governance rituals.
2. **High-Integrity Dashboarding**: The "Home" page is redesignated as the **Governance Center Cockpit**, providing the operator with a high-integrity window into the system's mechanical state.
3. **Operator Manual Synchronization**: Aligns the UI with the **RPAS-OPM.md** (Operator Manual), ensuring the 5 Governance Gates and Principle Guardrails are visible as "Pre-flight" checklist items.

## 3. Verification Evidence
- **UI Audit**: Verified that `Home.razor` correctly displays all 5 Integrity Gates.
- **Boundary Notice**: Verified that the "Operational Boundary Statement" is prominently displayed on the landing page.
- **AEV Pulse**: Verified that the cockit layout supports the integration of real-time integrity status (Phase 1 implementation).

## 4. Certification
The ADPA Governor Portal redesign is hereby certified as **Principle-Compliant** under the CSR-43 baseline. This layout becomes the mandatory standard for all high-integrity governance interfaces.
