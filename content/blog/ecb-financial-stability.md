A stable and efficient financial system is essential for sustainable growth and prosperity in the euro area. The ECB’s Financial Stability Review assesses the resilience of the euro area financial system and highlights key risks that could undermine its stability. Financial stability ultimately benefits all Europeans.

## Overall Assessment

### Key Takeaways

- Financial stability vulnerabilities remain elevated in the euro area amid heightened geopolitical and policy uncertainty, persistent market volatility, and structural challenges.
- While inflation pressures are receding and monetary policy has started to ease, growth prospects are subdued and risks are tilted to the downside.
- Sovereign vulnerabilities are increasing, especially in high-debt countries, due to weak fiscal fundamentals and sluggish potential growth.
- The banking sector remains resilient, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers, but faces rising credit risk in some segments and moderating profitability.
- Non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) are increasingly exposed to market and liquidity risks, with growing interconnectedness and leverage amplifying vulnerabilities.
- Macroprudential policy has focused on maintaining resilience, with increased capital buffer requirements and ongoing reforms to address risks in both the banking and non-bank sectors.

## The Euro Area Financial System in 2025: Resilience Amid Uncertainty

Since late 2024, the euro area has faced a volatile macro-financial environment. Geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainty, and global trade frictions have triggered bouts of market volatility and heightened the risk of tail events. While financial markets have so far absorbed these shocks, underlying vulnerabilities—such as high asset valuations, risk concentration, and liquidity mismatches—persist.

## Macro-Financial and Geopolitical Risks

- The balance of risks has shifted from inflation concerns to fears of weaker growth, with structural headwinds compounding cyclical challenges.
- Geopolitical risks, including ongoing conflicts and trade tensions, have increased uncertainty and could trigger further market volatility or abrupt shifts in sentiment.
- Fiscal challenges remain acute in several euro area countries, with high debt levels and limited policy space to respond to shocks.

## Households

- Household vulnerabilities have eased, supported by robust employment, wage growth, and higher savings, but pockets of risk remain among low-income and highly indebted households.
- Debt-to-income ratios have declined to levels last seen in 2005, but debt service costs remain elevated for some cohorts.
- A high propensity to save is supporting household balance sheets but may weigh on consumption and slow the economic recovery.

## Non-Financial Businesses

- Corporate balance sheets are under pressure from high funding costs and weak growth, especially in commercial real estate (CRE) and among SMEs.
- Insolvencies are rising from low levels, reflecting the phasing-out of pandemic support and continued economic weakness.
- New borrowing remains subdued, with tight lending standards and weak demand, particularly in capital-intensive sectors.

## Sovereign and Market Risks

- Sovereign vulnerabilities are rising due to high debt, weak fiscal fundamentals, and policy uncertainty, especially following recent elections in some countries.
- Market volatility has increased, with sharp but short-lived corrections in equity and bond markets. High valuations and risk concentration, especially in technology stocks, raise the risk of abrupt repricing.
- The euro area remains exposed to global spillovers, particularly from the US and China, and to risks from further geopolitical fragmentation.

## Banking Sector Resilience

- Euro area banks remain resilient, with strong capital and liquidity buffers and historically low non-performing loan (NPL) ratios.
- Asset quality is deteriorating slowly, mainly in CRE, SMEs, and consumer credit, but exposures are manageable in aggregate.
- Bank profitability remains high but is moderating as net interest income peaks and lending margins compress.
- Market valuations of banks remain subdued, reflecting concerns about growth and structural challenges.

## Non-Bank Financial Sector

- NBFIs play a growing role in market-based finance but face valuation, liquidity, and leverage risks, especially in investment funds and insurers.
- High concentration in equity holdings, increased exposure to US assets, and liquidity mismatches in open-ended funds amplify vulnerabilities.
- The insurance sector remains resilient, but climate-related risks and the insurance protection gap are growing concerns.

## Macroprudential Policy and Outlook

- Macroprudential authorities have increased capital buffer requirements and maintained borrower-based measures to preserve resilience.
- Ongoing reforms aim to enhance the policy framework for NBFIs, address liquidity and leverage risks, and improve data sharing and supervision.
- Progress on the capital markets union and further integration of supervision are key to supporting productivity, growth, and financial stability.
