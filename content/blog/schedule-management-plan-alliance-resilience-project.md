# Schedule Management Plan

**Project:** Alliance Resilience Project

**Project ID:** 08bef030-8f72-4360-a3b0-dc0192bf4405

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** 2025-04-15

**Prepared By:** Menno Drescher, Project Manager

## 1. Executive Summary

The Schedule Management Plan (SMP) for the Alliance Resilience Project establishes a structured framework for defining, sequencing, estimating, developing, and controlling the project schedule in alignment with PMBOK® Guide (7th Edition) principles. This plan ensures timely delivery of the modular Automated Diplomatic Protocol Automation (ADPA) system, which aims to automate diplomatic clearances and asset relocations for VIP aircraft (e.g., Qatari 747-8) across NATO/EU hubs such as Lelystad and Schiphol.

The project incorporates lessons from the Kabul evacuation, including predictive drift detection for militia threats, 48-hour airstrip orchestration via baseline extraction, and need-to-know compliance logs. The SMP outlines the processes for activity definition, sequencing, estimation, schedule development, and control, ensuring alignment with NATO Air Command’s strategic objectives and operational requirements.

Key objectives include:

- Reducing diplomatic clearance processing time by 60% through automation.
- Improving threat detection accuracy by 90% using AI/ML models.
- Achieving full operational readiness within 24 months of project initiation.

This plan integrates with the Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, and Resource Management Plan to ensure consistency and traceability across project domains.
