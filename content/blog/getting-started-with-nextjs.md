# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications a breeze. Let's explore how to get started!

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several benefits:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
- **API Routes**

## Creating Your First App

To create a new Next.js app, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project looks like this:

```
my-app/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── layout.tsx
  │   └── page.tsx
  ├── public/
  │   └── images/
  ├── components/
  └── package.json
```

## Adding a New Page

Creating a new page is as simple as adding a new file:

```typescript
// app/about/page.tsx
export default function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our site!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
