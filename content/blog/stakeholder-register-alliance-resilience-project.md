1. Executive Summary
The Alliance Resilience Project is a high-priority NATO initiative under the PMBOK® Guide (7th Edition) framework, designed to enhance the operational resilience of diplomatic and military aviation operations across NATO and EU airspace. The project aims to develop a modular Automated Diplomatic Protocol Automation (ADPA) system to streamline and automate diplomatic clearances and asset relocations for VIP aircraft (e.g., Qatari 747-8) at key hubs such as Lelystad and Schiphol.

This Stakeholder Register provides a comprehensive analysis of all identified stakeholders, their power/influence, interest levels, and engagement strategies to ensure effective communication, risk mitigation, and value delivery. The register aligns with PMBOK 7’s Stakeholder Performance Domain, emphasizing stakeholder engagement, adaptive planning, and value-driven outcomes.

Key objectives include:
●	Reducing diplomatic clearance processing time by 60%
●	Improving threat detection accuracy by 90%
●	Achieving full operational readiness within 24 months

This document serves as a living artifact, requiring periodic review and updates to reflect evolving stakeholder dynamics.
