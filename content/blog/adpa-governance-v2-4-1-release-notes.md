# 💎 RPAS‑CM v2.4.1 (CSR‑43) — Release Notes

### **Baseline Certification Epoch: 2026-04-13**

The **RPAS‑CM v2.4.1** baseline (CSR‑43) formalizes the transition from primitive AEV validation to **High-Integrity Semantic Governance** via the **DRACO Review Board**. This release focuses on performance, resilience, and operational transparency.

---

## 🚀 **Key Improvements**

### **1. DRACO Performance Optimization (Gate 5)**
*   **Diff Truncation**: Implemented intelligent diff truncation (2000 lines / 100KB) to prevent IDE/System freeze during large state transitions.
*   **Sequential Staggering**: Introduced a 2-second stagger between agent runs to satisfy API rate limits and optimize CPU utilization.
*   **Manual Override**: Added `--step` mode for high-integrity manual inspection of agent verdicts.

### **2. AIService Resilience (Model 1 fallback)**
*   **Hardened Backoff**: Re-enabled exponential backoff with environment-based bypass (`DISABLE_AI_BACKOFF`) for certification rituals.
*   **Rugged Model Mapping**: All legacy Gemini variants are now dynamically mapped to `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` to prevent `503 Service Unavailable` errors during audit peak loads.

### **3. Governance Cockpit UI**
*   **Unified Dashboard**: Redesigned `Home.razor` as a premium "Governance Cockpit" using glassmorphic design principles.
*   **Process Transparency**: Integrated real-time G1-G5 principle visibility and mandatory gate status.

---

## 🛡️ **Operational Invariants (Fixed)**
*   Corrected structural regressions in `draco-gate-5.ts` that occasionally bypassed the audit loop in automated mode.
*   Resolved port conflicts (`3005` → `3006`) between .NET Aspire and Docker-managed services.
*   Purged high-volume local log leaks from the git history to maintain repository hygiene.
