# Essential Web Development Tips

## 1. Write Clean Code

> "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." - Martin Fowler

### Key Principles:
- Keep it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- SOLID Principles

## 2. Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization
- Use modern formats (WebP)
- Implement lazy loading
- Provide responsive images

Example:
```html
<img
  src="image.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  srcset="image-300.webp 300w,
          image-600.webp 600w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 300px,
         600px"
  alt="Optimized image"
>
```

## 3. Accessibility

Make your websites accessible:

- [ ] Use semantic HTML
- [x] Add ARIA labels where needed
- [x] Ensure keyboard navigation
- [ ] Maintain good color contrast

## 4. Testing

Different types of testing:

| Type | Purpose | Tools |
|------|---------|-------|
| Unit | Test individual components | Jest |
| Integration | Test component interactions | Cypress |
| E2E | Test full user flows | Playwright |

## 5. Version Control

Essential Git commands:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

Remember to:
1. Write clear commit messages
2. Review your changes
3. Keep branches up to date
