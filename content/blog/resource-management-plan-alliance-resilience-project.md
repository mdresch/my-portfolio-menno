---

1. Executive Summary
The Alliance Resilience Project is a high-priority NATO initiative designed to enhance the operational resilience of diplomatic and military aviation operations across NATO and EU airspace. The project aims to develop a modular Automated Diplomatic Protocol Automation (ADPA) system to streamline and automate diplomatic clearances and asset relocations for VIP aircraft (e.g., Qatari 747-8) at key hubs such as Lelystad and Schiphol. The system will incorporate critical lessons learned from the Kabul evacuation, including predictive drift detection for militia threats, 48-hour airstrip orchestration via baseline extraction, and need-to-know compliance logs that evolve from test flights to full operational readiness.

This Resource Management Plan (RMP) defines the approach for identifying, acquiring, developing, managing, and controlling both human and physical resources required to deliver the ADPA system successfully. Aligned with the PMBOK® Guide (7th Edition), this plan ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, team competencies are developed, and physical assets are procured and managed in accordance with NATO’s operational and security standards.

Key objectives of this RMP include:
- Establishing a cross-functional, dedicated project team with clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and competencies.
- Defining a resource acquisition strategy that leverages internal NATO capabilities and external vendor partnerships.
- Implementing a team development strategy to address skill gaps and foster collaboration in a high-security environment.
- Managing physical resources, including cloud infrastructure, specialized software, and hardware, to support system development and deployment.
- Ensuring resource control and governance through structured change management and performance monitoring.

This plan is designed to be executable, measurable, and adaptable, with regular reviews to ensure alignment with project objectives and stakeholder expectations.

2. Resource Planning

2.1 Project Overview and Resource Requirements
The Alliance Resilience Project requires a hybrid resource management approach, combining predictive and adaptive elements to address the project’s complexity and security requirements. The project will follow a phased development lifecycle, with resource needs evolving across the following key phases:
1. Initiation and Planning (Months 1-3)
2. System Design and Architecture (Months 4-6)
3. Development and Integration (Months 7-12)
4. Testing and Validation (Months 13-18)
5. Deployment and Operational Readiness (Months 19-24)

2.1.1 Human Resource Requirements
The project team will consist of internal NATO personnel, external contractors, and third-party vendors, with a focus on cross-functional collaboration and specialized expertise. Key roles and their required competencies are outlined in Section 3.2.

2.1.2 Physical Resource Requirements
Physical resources include:
- Cloud Infrastructure: Dedicated environments for development, testing, and staging (AWS GovCloud or NATO-approved alternatives).
- Software Licenses: Specialized tools for AI/ML development, compliance logging, and diplomatic protocol automation.
- Hardware: Secure workstations, testing equipment, and integration tools for real-time air traffic data.
- Materials: Training materials, compliance documentation, and operational manuals.

2.2 Resource Management Approach
The resource management approach is tailored to the project’s hybrid development methodology, which combines predictive planning for infrastructure and procurement with adaptive team management for development and testing.

2.2.1 Human Resource Approach
- Team Structure: A dedicated, cross-functional team reporting to the Project Manager, with matrixed support from functional departments (e.g., NATO IT Support, Compliance).
- Team Development: Focus on servant leadership and collaborative decision-making to foster innovation and accountability.
- Acquisition Strategy: Internal allocation for NATO personnel; external procurement for specialized roles (e.g., AI/ML engineers, third-party vendors).

2.2.2 Physical Resource Approach
- Procurement Strategy: Centralized procurement via NATO’s Procurement Manager, with vendor selection based on security compliance and technical capability.
- Logistics Plan: Secure storage and distribution of physical assets, with real-time tracking for high-value items.
- Resource Control: Inventory management via NATO’s asset tracking system, with quarterly audits by the NATO Financial Compliance Team.

2.2.3 Alignment with PMBOK 7 Principles
This RMP aligns with the following PMBOK 7 Principles:
1. Stewardship: Responsible management of NATO resources to deliver value.
2. Team: Building a collaborative, high-performing team.
3. Stakeholders: Engaging stakeholders to ensure resource needs are met.
4. Value: Ensuring resources contribute to project outcomes.
5. Systems Thinking: Managing resources as part of an integrated system.
6. Leadership: Empowering team members to take ownership of their roles.
7. Tailoring: Adapting resource management processes to the project’s unique context.
