# Global Lighthouse Network

Global Lighthouse Network is a collaborative platform that brings together leading industrial organizations that are pioneering the use of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies in manufacturing. Some key points about the Lighthouse Network:

- The network was co-founded in 2018 by the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company.
- It currently has 189 member sites across over 30 countries and 35 sectors.
- The network recognizes factories and production facilities that have achieved exceptional performance in areas like productivity, supply chain resilience, customer centricity, sustainability, and talent development through the use of advanced digital technologies.

Some of the companies and facilities that are part of the Global Lighthouse Network include:

- **Schneider Electric**: The company has 7 factories recognized as Lighthouses, including sites in Shanghai, China and Monterrey, Mexico.
- **Agilent Technologies**: Two of Agilent's smart factories in Asia have been named as Lighthouses.
- **UMC**: UMC's flagship Fab 12A facility in Tainan, Taiwan is the first semiconductor foundry globally to earn Lighthouse status.
- **Aramco**: Five of Aramco's facilities, including the North Ghawar Oil Producing Complex, have been added to the Lighthouse Network.
- **CITIC Dicastal**: The company's factory in Morocco is the first Lighthouse site in Africa.
- **Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL)**: HUL's Doomdummer factory has been recognized as an end-to-end value chain Lighthouse.

The Lighthouse Network serves as a platform for these leading industrial organizations to share best practices and learnings in leveraging 4IR technologies to drive operational excellence and sustainability.
