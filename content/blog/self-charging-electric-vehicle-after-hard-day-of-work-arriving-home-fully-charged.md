The Self Charging Electric Vehicles.

Recent developments in self-charging electric vehicle (EV) technologies are quite exciting! Here are some key advancements:

1. **Solar Panels Integration**: Self-charging EVs are increasingly using solar panels integrated into their exteriors. This allows them to generate power while in motion or parked, reducing the need for frequent stops at charging stations.
<br>
2. **Battery Innovations**: New battery technologies, such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and solid-state batteries, are being developed to offer faster charging times, lower costs, and improved safety.
<br>
3. **Bidirectional Charging**: Market-ready bidirectional charging, also known as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capability, allows EVs to power home appliances and keep the lights on during power outages.

These advancements are paving the way for a more sustainable and efficient future in mobility.
