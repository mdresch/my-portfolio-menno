## Quality Management Plan (QMP)

**Project:** Alliance Resilience Project

**Version:** 1.0.1

**Date:** 2026-01-10

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the QMP

The project team establishes this Quality Management Plan (QMP) to define how the Alliance Resilience Project achieves and maintains the highest standards of quality throughout the development and deployment of the Automated Diplomatic Protocol Automation (ADPA) system. This document serves as the authoritative framework for quality planning, assurance, and control, ensuring that all deliverables meet NATO Air Command’s operational requirements and compliance standards. The QMP aligns with PMBOK® Guide (7th Edition) principles, particularly the Quality Performance Domain, by integrating quality management into every phase of the project lifecycle.

The ADPA system’s success hinges on its ability to automate diplomatic clearances, detect militia threats through predictive analytics, and orchestrate airstrip operations within 48 hours—all while maintaining need-to-know compliance logs. This QMP ensures that these critical functionalities are delivered with precision, reliability, and adherence to NATO’s stringent security protocols. By embedding quality management into the project’s DNA, the team mitigates risks such as system failures, compliance breaches, and operational inefficiencies, which could jeopardize the project’s strategic objectives.

### 1.2 Project Overview

The Alliance Resilience Project is a high-priority NATO initiative designed to enhance the operational resilience of diplomatic and military aviation operations across NATO and EU airspace. The project focuses on developing a modular ADPA system to streamline and automate diplomatic clearances and asset relocations for VIP aircraft, such as the Qatari 747-8, at key hubs like Lelystad and Schiphol. The system incorporates lessons learned from the Kabul evacuation, including predictive drift detection for militia threats, 48-hour airstrip orchestration via baseline extraction, and need-to-know compliance logs that evolve from test flights to full operational readiness.

As outlined in the Project Charter and Business Case Template, the ADPA system must achieve the following high-level objectives:

1. Reduce diplomatic clearance processing time by 60% through automation and real-time data integration.
2. Improve threat detection accuracy by 90% using AI-driven predictive analytics.
3. Ensure 100% compliance with NATO and EU diplomatic protocols and security regulations.
4. Achieve full operational readiness within 24 months, with incremental deployments at key NATO/EU hubs.
5. Close alliance cooperation gaps by standardizing diplomatic clearance processes across member states.

This QMP ensures that these objectives are met through rigorous quality planning, assurance, and control processes, as detailed in the subsequent sections.
