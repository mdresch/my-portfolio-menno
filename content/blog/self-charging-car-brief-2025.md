Self-charging cars represent a new frontier in electric vehicle (EV) technology. These vehicles aim to reduce or eliminate the need for external charging by harnessing energy from sources such as solar panels, regenerative braking, and advanced kinetic systems.

## Industry Overview and Recent Developments

- **Sono Motors GmbH**: After cancelling its Sion project in 2023, Sono Motors has shifted focus to solar kits for trucks, buses, and RVs, moving away from solar-powered vehicles to broader applications.
- **Mercedes-Benz Group AG (MBG)**: The company, along with Stellantis, has withdrawn earnings forecasts due to industry-wide tariff impacts, highlighting the broad effect on automakers.
- **Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)**: BMW is pursuing legal action against the 31% EU tariff on Chinese EVs, seeking political solutions and warning of possible supply bottlenecks and deviations in 2025 performance. The company is also reducing its dealer network in China and securing new investors to stabilize profitability.
- **Denso Corp. (6902)**: Denso is strengthening innovation and semiconductor partnerships, notably with ROHM, to target next-generation vehicle systems, electrification, and automated driving.
- **Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (7201)**: Nissan has abandoned plans for a Â¥153 billion battery plant, instead focusing on a new Leaf EV for 2026 and a partnership with Mitsubishi for a new EV launch.
- **Dassault Systemes SE (DSY)**: Driven by strong growth expectations, Dassault faces risks associated with its high P/E ratio and the need to deliver on these expectations.
- **Volvo AB (VOLV.B)**: Volvo has closed its Silicon Valley innovation hub and continues to lead in electric trucks, with over 5,000 battery-electric trucks delivered globally. Demand for gas-powered trucks has also increased.
- **Aptera Motors Corp.**: Aptera has integrated 700 watts of solar panels into its vehicles, allowing up to 64 km/day on solar power, and plans to scale production in California.
- **Ferrari N.V. (RACE)**: Ferrari maintains a confident 2025 outlook despite tariffs, with first EV deliveries expected and a strong order book extending into 2027.
- **BYD Co. Ltd. (002594)**: BYD aims for 5 million global sales in 2025, with 80% from China, and is expanding into Europe despite geopolitical challenges.
- **Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)**: Microsoft has banned the Deepseek AI app over data vulnerability concerns and is funding a $1 million AI Accelerator Grant for ovarian cancer research.
- **Tesla Inc. (TSLA)**: Tesla has cancelled the Cybertruck range extender, refunding deposits to customers.

## Key Points
- Self-charging EVs use built-in solar panels, regenerative braking, or other innovative methods to recharge their batteries while driving or parked.
- The technology promises greater convenience and reduced reliance on charging infrastructure.
- Current limitations include energy conversion efficiency, cost, and the amount of energy that can be realistically harvested.
- Ongoing research and development are rapidly improving the viability of self-charging systems.

## Outlook
While fully self-sustaining cars are not yet mainstream, hybrid approaches are already extending the range and usability of modern EVs. As technology advances, self-charging features are expected to become a standard part of the electric vehicle landscape.
