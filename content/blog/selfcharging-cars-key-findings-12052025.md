## Company Spotlights

### Bentley Systems Inc. (BSY)

**Bentley Systems, Inc.** identifies India as the primary growth driver in the Asia Pacific region, leveraging massive government investments and global firms outsourcing structural engineering to India.

The company is expected to grow slower than other industry participants, but analysts have upgraded their earnings per share estimates, indicating increased optimism. Revenue estimates remain unchanged, suggesting alignment with expectations despite the anticipated slower growth.

### Denso Corp. (6902)

**DENSO Corp.** solidifies a strategic partnership with ROHM Co., Ltd. in the semiconductor field, focusing on next-generation vehicle systems such as electrification, automated driving, and connected vehicles.

The company will initially focus on the development of analog ICs, essential for vehicle intelligence and electrification, as part of this strategic partnership.

DENSO will acquire a portion of ROHM's shares to further solidify the partnership and ensure a stable supply of highly reliable semiconductor products.

### Waymo LLC

**Waymo's** partnership with Uber is evolving, with the pilot in Austin exceeding expectations and plans for a rollout in Atlanta. However, Uber is also expanding partnerships with other autonomous tech providers like WeRide and Volkswagen.

### Peugeot Invest S.A. (PEUG)

**Peugeot Invest S.A.** partners with Charterhouse Capital Partners through a minority investment of approximately EUR105 million, representing over 19% of the share capital of Novétude, a leading healthcare education group.

The company supports the development of Novétude, which specializes in training for paramedical professions, offering accredited degrees in osteopathy, physiotherapy, optics, dental care, and pharmacy.

### Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)

**Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)** is managing electric vehicle production by focusing on increasing economies of scale, aiming to reach 50% electric vehicle production to reduce manufacturing costs per unit.

The company reported a 7.8% revenue decline in Q1 2025 to EUR33.8 billion, alongside a 26.4% drop in net profit to EUR2.2 billion, reflecting tighter economic conditions and the pressures of transitioning to electric vehicles.

### Volvo AB (VOLV.B)

**Volvo AB (VOLV.B)** faces potential challenges due to its Chinese ownership, which may lead to restrictions or bans in key markets.

**Volvo AB (VOLV.B)** recently sold bonds with a starting new issue premium of about 45 basis points, which could tighten according to analysts, though caution remains due to tariff risks and softening demand.

**Volvo AB (VOLV.B)** and Daimler Truck announced a joint venture to develop a unified software-defined vehicle platform and a dedicated truck operating system, aiming to drive the digital transformation of heavy-duty trucks.

### BYD Co. Ltd. (002594)

**BYD's** plan to create a vertically integrated supply chain in Chile, from raw materials to battery production, has likely been disrupted by the lithium price crash. BYD may now find it more cost-effective to use its existing Chinese facilities.

The company is emphasizing its Europe expansion as pivotal to hitting its 2030 target, despite remaining locked out of the US market by trade barriers.

### Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)

**Toyota** plans to mitigate the impact of tariffs by increasing investments in next-generation technologies, including its Arene OS, vehicle batteries, and the Woven City project in Shizuoka Prefecture.

Toyota's partnership with Maruti Suzuki may face challenges as Maruti prioritizes exports, potentially limiting the supply of rebadged models and constraining future sales volumes in India.

### Volkswagen AG (VOW)

**Volkswagen AG (VOW)** is set to radically reinvent the Golf as an advanced electric car in its ninth generation, marking a significant pivot in its EV strategy. The new ID Golf, expected in 2028 or 2029, will be a cornerstone of Volkswagen's electric vehicle lineup, merging the traditional Golf name with its ID sub-brand.

The ID Golf will utilize the SSP electric platform and a new software architecture developed in partnership with U.S. start-up Rivian, highlighting Volkswagen's commitment to advanced technology and software-defined performance. This model will be followed by other key EVs, including an SUV to succeed the ID 4 and potentially continue the Tiguan model line.

Volkswagen's electric vehicle strategy overhaul, led by CEO Thomas Schäfer, will begin with the launch of three entry-level EVs: the ID 2X compact SUV, the ID 2all hatchback, and the ID Every1 city car. These models, priced from approximately £17,000 to £25,000, will precede the ID Golf's arrival and are expected to significantly bolster Volkswagen's market presence in the EV segment.

The Golf GTI and R performance variants will return in electric form with the ID Golf, featuring software-enabled performance systems such as torque vectoring and regenerative braking. The GTI will retain two-wheel drive, while the R will adopt all-wheel drive through a dual-motor configuration.

### Tesla Inc. (TSLA)

**Tesla (TSLA)** has halted production of the Model Y and Cybertruck at its Austin, Texas factory for the week of Memorial Day due to inventory surplus and softening demand.

### Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)

**Alphabet** is under legal pressure from the DOJ's antitrust proposals, which aim to force Google to share search data with competitors to increase competition in the search market.

Google's market share in global search engine traffic has declined from about 93% to just under 90% since the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late November 2022, indicating a shift towards AI tools for answers.

Google ad chief Vidhya Srinivasan is pushing for the inclusion of ads in Gemini AI chatbot answers to compensate for generative AI tools' eventual cannibalization of Google Search.

### Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)

**Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)** is negotiating to give up some of its equity stake in OpenAI's new for-profit business in exchange for accessing new AI models developed beyond 2030, as part of a restructuring that will allow OpenAI to go public.

The company is offering to reduce its equity stake in exchange for guaranteed access to new technologies developed after the 2030 cutoff date, as stipulated in its current contractual agreement.

Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI to date and is a key holdout needed to approve the restructuring.

### Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)

**Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)** announced its entry into the quantum-computing race with the launch of its quantum chip, Ocelot, in February 2025, aiming to enhance its cloud computing services and compete with rivals like Google, Microsoft, and IBM.
