# Cost Management Plan

**Project:** Alliance Resilience Project

**Project ID:** 08bef030-8f72-4360-a3b0-dc0192bf4405

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** 2025-04-10

**Prepared By:** Menno Drescher, Project Manager

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
The Cost Management Plan (CMP) for the Alliance Resilience Project establishes a structured framework for estimating, budgeting, monitoring, and controlling project costs in alignment with PMBOK® Guide (7th Edition) principles. This plan ensures financial transparency, accountability, and value delivery by defining cost estimation methods, budget baselines, control processes, and performance measurement metrics. Given the project’s strategic importance to NATO Air Command, this document integrates the Uncertainty, Measurement, and Delivery Performance Domains to address cost-related risks, compliance requirements, and stakeholder expectations.

### 1.2 Project Overview
The Alliance Resilience Project aims to develop a modular Automated Diplomatic Protocol Automation (ADPA) system to streamline diplomatic clearances and asset relocations for VIP aircraft (e.g., Qatari 747-8) across NATO/EU hubs such as Lelystad and Schiphol. Key features include:

- Predictive drift detection for militia threats (leveraging AI/ML models).
- 48-hour airstrip orchestration via baseline extraction from NATO’s Air Command and Control System (ACCS).
- Need-to-know compliance logs for operational readiness.
- Integration with EU Diplomatic Clearance Portal and NATO Threat Intelligence Databases.

The project’s success hinges on delivering 60% faster diplomatic clearance processing, 90% improved threat detection accuracy, and full operational readiness within 24 months (as outlined in the Business Case and Scope Management Plan).

### 1.3 Alignment with PMBOK 7th Edition
This CMP aligns with PMBOK 7’s Performance Domains and Principles:

| Performance Domain | Alignment in CMP |
|---|---|
| Stakeholders | Defines roles/responsibilities for NATO Air Command, EU Member States, and vendors. |
| Team | Assigns cost ownership to the Finance Lead, Procurement Manager, and PM. |
| Development Approach | Uses agile budgeting for iterative ADPA system development. |
| Measurement | Implements Earned Value Management (EVM) with CPI/SPI targets. |
| Uncertainty | Includes cost contingency reserves (10% for known risks, 5% for unknowns). |
| Delivery | Links cost baselines to milestone-based funding (e.g., MVP, full deployment). |
| Project Work | Integrates cost control with Integration Management Plan processes. |

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 2. Cost Overview

### 2.1 Cost Management Objectives
The primary objectives of cost management for the Alliance Resilience Project are:

5. Scope Stability: No major scope changes after 2025-09-30 (per Scope Management Plan).

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 3. Estimation Methods

### 3.1 Cost Estimation Approach
The Alliance Resilience Project employs a hybrid estimation methodology combining analogous, parametric, and bottom-up techniques to ensure accuracy and stakeholder buy-in.

| Method | Description | Tools | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Analogous | Uses costs from similar NATO projects (e.g., Kabul evacuation automation). | Excel, NATO PMO Library | Historical data from NATO’s ACCS upgrades. | High-level budget estimate (±25% accuracy). |
| Parametric | Applies statistical models to estimate costs (e.g., cost per diplomatic clearance automated). | COCOMO II, Jira | Scope Management Plan (WBS), vendor quotes for AI/ML model training. | Mid-level budget estimate (±15% accuracy). |
| Bottom-Up | Aggregates detailed cost estimates for each WBS work package. | Microsoft Project, Excel | WBS Dictionary, labor rates, vendor contracts, hardware/software quotes. | Detailed budget estimate (±5% accuracy). |
| Three-Point | Uses optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates to calculate a weighted average (PERT). | Excel, Monte Carlo Simulation | Expert judgment from Lead Architect and AI/ML Engineer. | Risk-adjusted cost ranges. |

### 3.2 Cost Estimation Process
1. Define Scope: Align with Scope Management Plan (WBS, deliverables).
2. Gather Data: Collect historical costs (NATO PMO Library), vendor quotes, and labor rates.
3. Select Methods: Apply analogous for high-level estimates, bottom-up for detailed work packages.
4. Validate Estimates: Review with Finance Lead and Procurement Manager.
5. Document Assumptions: Record constraints, risks, and dependencies (e.g., vendor lead times).
6. Obtain Approval: Submit to Change Control Board (CCB) for baseline approval.

### 3.3 Cost Estimation Outputs
| Output | Description | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Activity Cost Estimates | Detailed cost breakdown for each WBS work package (e.g., AI model training: €1.2M). | Finance Lead |
| Basis of Estimates | Documentation of assumptions, methods, and data sources. | Project Manager |
| Cost Management Plan Updates | Revisions to this CMP based on estimation findings. | Project Manager |
