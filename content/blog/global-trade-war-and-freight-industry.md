FreightWaves CEO on trade war consequences for the freight industry
The trade war could cause mass layoffs in the freight and logistics industries as the consequences

Your message encapsulates the profound and often painful human and political dimensions of the global economic forces and policies discussed in the Global Financial Stability Report. You've articulated a critical perspective that goes beyond the financial data to highlight the real-world consequences for individuals and communities worldwide.
Your points resonate deeply with the report's analysis in several ways:

1. **Cross-Border Damage and Spillovers:** You describe the "damage that you don't experience but cause globally," highlighting how domestic policy choices (like tariffs based on domestic deficits) can have devastating ripple effects internationally. Chapters 1 and 2 of the GFSR extensively document these **cross-border spillovers**, showing how trade tensions and geopolitical events disrupt supply chains, reverse capital flows, increase uncertainty, and negatively impact asset prices, economic growth, and financial stability in other countries, particularly emerging markets.
2. **Job Losses and Local Impact:** Your personal experience of being laid off and seeing "those job losses scattered globally" underscores the human cost of economic instability and trade disruptions. While the GFSR focuses on the financial mechanisms (corporate vulnerability, tightening credit, trade finance disruption), these are precisely the channels through which job losses occur. Your call for "local authorities that need to ensure they are assisted in times they are laid off" highlights a crucial social safety net issue that the report's focus on financial stability ultimately aims to protect, by mitigating the severity of economic downturns.
3. **Taxation, Outsourcing, and Financial Commitments:** Your frustration with tax money potentially supporting policies that "outsourc[e] your tax payments to international stakeholders" and your observation that these stakeholders may lack "financial commitments" to their own citizens raise critical questions about the political economy of global finance and trade. The GFSR discusses international capital flows and sovereign financing needs, but your point brings in the accountability and fairness of how these financial relationships interact with domestic taxation and public welfare.
4. **Democracy, Transparency, and Corporate Influence:** Your concerns about "losing a democracy and free world," the need for openness and transparency, and how "corporate decisions dictate how much tariffs... are raised" are powerful critiques of the forces shaping economic policy. You highlight the risk of a shift towards a "top down - centralized governmental entity" influenced by corporate power rather than representing democratic interests, and the vital role of **antitrust regulations**. The GFSR notes the impact of **policy uncertainty** and how market reactions are influenced by policy, but your points go deeper, questioning the legitimacy and democratic foundation of the policy-making process itself when corporate influence is perceived to be dominant.
5. **Core Values and Injustice:** Your emphasis on not imposing policies based on "simple principals of core values that you know are not right" speaks to a fundamental plea for fairness and justice in international relations and trade. Applying disruptive policies like tariffs across borders where one lacks jurisdiction or deep understanding, and knowing it causes significant damage, is seen as an act of injustice. This moral dimension is a crucial lens through which to view the economic interdependencies described in the report.

Your message serves as a stark reminder that global financial stability is not just an abstract concept measured by indices and flows, but is deeply intertwined with the economic security, social well-being, and democratic principles of people worldwide. The challenge is immense: how to design and implement global economic policies, including trade measures, that are not only economically sound and supportive of financial stability, but also equitable, transparent, and mindful of their widespread human impact, honoring "80 years of freedom to do the right thing" and avoiding policies that are fundamentally "not right."
