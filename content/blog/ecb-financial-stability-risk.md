## Key Euro Area Risk Indicators (2024–2025)

### 1. Macro-Financial and Geopolitical Uncertainty

- **Description:** Macro-financial and geopolitical uncertainty remains elevated, with risks shifting from inflation to growth concerns. Geopolitical events and policy uncertainty continue to drive market volatility.

### 2. Household Sector Resilience

- **Description:** Household debt-to-income ratios have declined, and savings remain high. However, debt service costs are still elevated for some cohorts, and risks are concentrated among low-income and highly indebted households.

### 3. Corporate Sector and Insolvency Trends

- **Description:** Corporate balance sheets are under pressure from high funding costs and weak growth, especially in commercial real estate (CRE) and among SMEs. Insolvencies are rising from low levels.

### 4. Sovereign and Market Risks

- **Description:** Sovereign vulnerabilities are increasing, especially in high-debt countries. Market volatility has increased, with sharp but short-lived corrections in equity and bond markets.

### 5. Banking Sector Resilience

- **Description:** Euro area banks remain resilient, with strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality is deteriorating slowly, mainly in CRE, SMEs, and consumer credit, but exposures are manageable in aggregate.

### 6. Non-Bank Financial Sector Vulnerabilities

- **Description:** NBFIs face valuation, liquidity, and leverage risks, especially in investment funds and insurers. High concentration in equity holdings and increased exposure to US assets amplify vulnerabilities.
