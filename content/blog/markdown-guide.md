# A Complete Guide to Markdown

Welcome to this comprehensive guide to Markdown syntax! In this post, we'll explore various Markdown features you can use in your blog posts.

## Basic Text Formatting

You can make text **bold** or *italic*. You can also combine them for ***bold and italic*** text.

You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ for deleted text.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
- Item 3

### Ordered Lists
1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2
3. Third item

## Links and Images

You can create [links to other websites](https://example.com) easily.

Images work similarly:
![Alt text for image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

## Code Blocks

Inline code uses single backticks: `const example = "hello world";`

For code blocks, use triple backticks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote
> It can span multiple lines
>
> And can have multiple paragraphs

## Tables

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

## Task Lists

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [x] Another completed task

## Horizontal Rules

Use three hyphens for a horizontal rule:

## Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote content.

## Final Notes

Remember that Markdown is designed to be:
1. Easy to read
2. Easy to write
3. Easy to convert to HTML
