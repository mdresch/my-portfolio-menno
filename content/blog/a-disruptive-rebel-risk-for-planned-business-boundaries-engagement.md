# A Disruptive Rebel: Risk for Planned Business Boundaries Engagement

Engaging a disruptive rebel in a business context can be both a risk and an opportunity. While such individuals often challenge the status quo and drive innovation, their approach may also create friction within established boundaries and processes.

## What is a Disruptive Rebel?
A disruptive rebel is someone who questions existing norms, introduces unconventional ideas, and is willing to take risks to achieve breakthrough results. In the context of business boundaries, this can mean pushing against traditional roles, hierarchies, or market limitations.

## Potential Risks
- **Cultural Resistance:** Established teams may resist change, leading to internal conflict or reduced morale.
- **Process Disruption:** Standard operating procedures may be challenged, causing temporary inefficiencies.
- **Reputational Impact:** Aggressive disruption can affect brand perception if not managed carefully.
- **Compliance Issues:** Rebels may overlook regulatory or policy requirements in pursuit of innovation.

## Potential Opportunities
- **Innovation Acceleration:** New ideas and approaches can lead to competitive advantage.
- **Market Expansion:** Challenging boundaries may open new markets or customer segments.
- **Talent Attraction:** A culture that welcomes rebels can attract other creative thinkers.

## Managing the Risk
- **Set Clear Boundaries:** Define which areas are open to disruption and which are not.
- **Foster Open Communication:** Encourage dialogue between rebels and traditionalists.
- **Monitor Compliance:** Ensure that innovation does not come at the expense of legal or ethical standards.
- **Align with Strategy:** Make sure disruptive efforts support overall business goals.

## Key Traits of a Disruptive Rebel in Business

### Bold
Disruptive rebels are unafraid to challenge established norms and take decisive action. Their boldness can inspire teams to think bigger and move beyond incremental improvements, driving transformative change within the organization.

### Tech-Savvy
A disruptive rebel often leverages the latest technologies to create innovative solutions. Their comfort with digital tools and emerging tech trends enables them to identify new opportunities and implement cutting-edge strategies that keep the business ahead of the curve.

### Risk-Tolerant
These individuals are willing to take calculated risks, understanding that failure is often a stepping stone to success. Their risk tolerance allows the organization to experiment, learn, and adapt quickly in a rapidly changing business environment.

### Comprehensive
A disruptive rebel takes a holistic view of challenges and opportunities. They consider the broader impact of their actions on the organization, market, and stakeholders, ensuring that innovation aligns with long-term strategic goals.

### Analytic
Despite their boldness, disruptive rebels rely on data and analysis to inform their decisions. They use metrics, research, and critical thinking to validate ideas and measure the impact of their initiatives, balancing intuition with evidence-based reasoning.

### Collaborative
While they may challenge the status quo, effective disruptive rebels know the value of collaboration. They build alliances across departments, encourage diverse perspectives, and foster a culture of open communication to ensure that innovation is sustainable and widely adopted.

### Why Agility Matters
Agility enables disruptive rebels to quickly adapt to changing circumstances, seize new opportunities, and pivot strategies when needed. In a fast-paced business environment, this flexibility is crucial for staying ahead of competitors and responding to market shifts.

### Streamlined
Disruptive rebels often seek to simplify processes and eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy. By streamlining workflows, they help organizations become more efficient, responsive, and focused on delivering value.

### Resourceful
Resourcefulness is a hallmark of disruptive rebels. They make the most of available assets, find creative solutions to obstacles, and turn constraints into opportunities for innovation and growth.

### Sharp
Sharpness refers to keen insight and quick thinking. Disruptive rebels are able to assess situations rapidly, identify key issues, and make informed decisions that drive progress and positive change.

### Best Practice: Leverage Tech for Efficiency
Disruptive rebels maximize efficiency by adopting and integrating cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and advanced analytics. By staying at the forefront of tech innovation, they streamline operations, enhance decision-making, and unlock new business opportunities. Organizations should encourage the exploration and responsible use of emerging technologies to maintain a competitive edge and drive sustainable growth.

### BEST PRACTICE: REDEFINE ROLES
No one can expect the job they have today to remain unchanged forever. Savvy organizations like the WMACs are responding by creating more flexible org charts and seeking out talent with more adaptable skills.

Many best-in-class companies are replacing rigid job descriptions with job architectures that allow for quick and cost-effective adaptation when human capital needs change.

> “Organizations are not necessarily hiring for fixed roles. They are looking at the work that needs to be done and the skills people need to do it,” says Manson-Smith.

Because of that, they can move people around more quickly as needs evolve. WMACs are also actively adjusting the skills and competencies they hire for, prioritizing skills like agility, curiosity, and the ability to learn and apply new things as much as, if not more than, experiences and education.

> “They’re asking, ‘Can we count on you to be adaptable and agile in the way you operate?’” Royal explains. “It’s a much more forward-looking way of hiring.”

And they’re extending that outlook to the professional development of existing employees as well.

### HOW TO FAIL FAST

This year’s WMACs (World’s Most Admired Companies) are not only agile in capturing opportunities—they also bounce back quickly from failure. Even the most meticulously thought-through strategy will fall flat sometimes. It happens to everyone—including some of the largest and most admired companies in the world.

WMACs tend to be culturally oriented to tolerate risk and failure. They recognize that when you are agile and curious, and you step outside of comfortable boundaries, you might not always get the result you want.

> “WMACs are likely to view well-chosen risks that don’t pan out as learning opportunities.”  
> — Mark Royal, Korn Ferry, Rebels with a Plan: Why the Best Companies are Disruptive

Here are three tenets WMACs employ to fail faster:

1. **Make it Safe**  
   Unless there’s misconduct at play, there is no need to penalize people whose new projects don’t work out. “Experimenting means allowing people to fail sometimes,” says Manson-Smith.

2. **Learn From It**  
   Conduct a quick postmortem to better understand what went wrong. WMACs are likely to view well-chosen risks that don’t pan out as learning opportunities.

3. **Move On**  
   Don’t dwell on past missteps. In the words of Samuel Beckett, “Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”

### HOW TO BUILD A CHANGE-READY TEAM
No organization becomes change-ready overnight. It takes effort to prepare management and employee teams to manage transformation.

On this, WMACs are ahead of the pack. Their tactics vary but tend to complement the six transformational mindsets Korn Ferry has identified as helpful in developing change-ready organizations. We call it **ADAPTS**:

- **A**
- **D**
- **A**
- **P**
- **T**
- **S**

#### The ADAPTS Model Explained

- **Anticipate the Unexpected**  
  Dispel workplace complacency and proactively look for early hints of changes to come.
- **Diversity of Perspectives**  
  Challenge established assumptions and seek alternative interpretations, driving innovation through diverse thinking.
- **Anchor on Purpose**  
  Assess new situations from the purpose lens, turning disruptions into opportunities.
- **Progress over Perfection**  
  Adopt an action-oriented approach, learning through doing and acting quickly to seize new opportunities rather than focusing solely on perfection.
- **Trust to Partner**  
  Rely on collective intelligence, bringing together knowledge, experience, and intuition from across the organization to respond to unexpected situations.
- **Sustain the Organization**  
  Demonstrate the ability to maintain operations while adapting to new challenges and changes.

#### CHANGE AGENTS
The ability to lead or support change, along with learning agility and curiosity, are cited by WMAC executives as the most important criteria for success for people in their companies.

### CHAMPIONS OF CHANGE
When asked to reflect on how the changing workplace has impacted them personally, top responses among WMAC executives were:

- “I feel positive about the impact our company is having and my role in it.”
- “I am leading the change; there is no way back.”
- “I feel energized about developing others in the company.”

These champions of change are not only adapting to transformation but are also inspiring and empowering those around them to embrace new opportunities and drive the organization forward.

### GUT-CHECK: ARE YOU READY?
Disruptive organizations need disruptive leadership. As you prepare to steer your organization towards a more innovative, agile, and change-ready future, experts recommend asking yourself three key questions:

**Q1. Am I stuck in the success trap?**  
“WMAC leaders are not captive to past success,” Royal explains. “They show a willingness to adapt and adjust despite past track records that might encourage them to just stay the course. They don’t assume what worked in the past will work in the future.”

**Q2. Am I connecting the dots?**  
“The best leaders look across all dimensions of what drives organizational performance, and they consider it all together,” says Manson-Smith. “They have a very clear growth strategy, and they really focus on aligning the whole organization to support it.”

**Q3. Am I a team player?**  
“Collaboration runs through a lot of what is involved in disruption,” says Royal. “Leaders have to think with an enterprise mindset about opportunities and challenges. That means asking, ‘Am I really as connected and collaborative as I can be to help the organization thrive?’”

### GAIN MORE INSIGHT
It takes effort to build organizations that can disrupt progressively, quickly, and effectively. And change is never easy. But the formidable performance of this year’s WMACs can’t be discounted.

To rise above the competition, it’s clear that organizations need to focus on innovation, agility, and change readiness. In 2025, disruption is simply smart.

> “The staying power of companies at the top of the WMAC list is notable.

> “The world’s most admired companies don’t earn their ranking through financial results alone. They also get there through the reputation of their leadership, their ability to attract and retain top talent, and a strong culture,” said Laura Manson-Smith, Korn Ferry’s global leader of organization strategy consulting. “The best strategy on paper is worth nothing without an engaged and skilled workforce to make it happen.”

> “Fortune is proud to recognize all the companies on this year’s World’s Most Admired Companies list, especially the top 50 All-Stars, who represent the pinnacle of excellence across industries,” said Alyson Shontell, Fortune Editor in Chief. “Their ability to consistently earn this recognition is truly impressive and a testament to their high standards, resilience, and vision in a challenging global business environment.”

Korn Ferry and Fortune analyzed 650 companies and surveyed more than 3,300 executives to measure reputation based on nine different attributes, including each firm’s effectiveness in conducting business globally, its ability to attract, develop, and keep talent, its value as a long-term investment, its innovativeness, its wise use of corporate assets, and its responsibility to the community and environment.
