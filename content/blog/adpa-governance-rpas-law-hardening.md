# ✅ RPAS‑CM Law Hardening Protocol

## Purpose

This document defines the mandatory process for transitioning governance laws from **definition** to **enforcement**. It ensures that laws are proven safe, deterministic, and non-destructive before they can block execution.

**Core Principle:**
> Laws must be proven before they are enforced.  
> One enforced law is worth more than ten theoretical ones.

## Lawful system posture & the administrator role

**System hardening** in RPAS terms is the upgrade toward a **lawful system**: governance rules are expressed where possible as **mechanical** checks (validators, API validation, database transition rules, orchestration invariants)—constraints that behave like **deterministic invariants** (same state → same verdict), not as informal policy that any privileged account can ignore.

**Administrator role:** The administrator **must not be enabled** to bypass those requirements. The role transitions from a classical **super‑administrator** (implicit omnipotence) to a **law governor**: defining and changing law only through governed rituals, while **execution** remains subject to the same mechanical laws as everyone else. If the system was never designed to grant a path, **mechanical enforcement** prevents anyone—including an administrator—from treating that path as available.

**Law change and tokens:** A change of law is itself a governed mutation. After definition and hardening phases permit it, **requests for validation** (against the manifest, ledger, transition matrix, and related validators) must succeed before **cryptographic authority tokens** are issued. Tokens prove that the work is **scoped** to what validation allowed under the **current** law set; they are the bridge between **human decisions about law** and **machine‑enforceable permission to act**.

## 1. Law Lifecycle Phases

Every RPAS law progresses through these phases:

| Phase | Name | Description | Blocking? |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|
| 0 | **Definition** | Law is written, not implemented | No |
| 1 | **Instrumentation** | Validators, middleware, telemetry created | No |
| 2 | **Shadow Evaluation** | Law runs in parallel, logs violations | No |
| 3 | **Evidence Collection** | Metrics gathered, false positives identified | No |
| 4 | **Validation** | Law proven safe, no negative side effects | No |
| 5 | **Constitutional Enforcement** | Law blocks violations, tokens denied | Yes |

**Critical Rule:**
> Skipping phases 2–4 creates *governance-induced system failure*, which RPAS explicitly forbids.

## 2. Phase Details

### Phase 0: Definition

**Status:** Law written as policy document  
**Blocking:** No  
**Artifacts:** Markdown governance document (e.g., `RPAS-COL.md`, `RPAS-TCL.md`)

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Law text is complete and unambiguous
- [ ] Violation codes defined
- [ ] Related laws identified
- [ ] Human review completed

---

### Phase 1: Instrumentation

**Status:** Technical implementation created  
**Blocking:** No  
**Artifacts:** C# validators, middleware, services

**Exit Criteria:**

### Phase 2: Shadow Evaluation (Critical)

**Mode:** Pre-Authoritative Law Evaluation

**Implementation:**
```

## 4. Current Law Status

| Law | Phase | Blocking | Status |
|-----|-------|----------|--------|
| CP1 — Tier Collision Prevention | 5 | Yes | Enforced |
| CP2 — Execution Collision Prevention | 5 | Yes | Enforced |
| CP3 — Amendment Collision Prevention | 5 | Yes | Enforced |

---

## 5. Graduation Criteria

A law graduates from Phase N to Phase N+1 when:

1. **All exit criteria for Phase N are met**
2. **No unresolved issues from Phase N**
3. **Human approval obtained (Phases 4→5)**
4. **CSR epoch assigned (Phases 4→5)**

---

## 6. Rollback Procedure

If a law in Phase 5 causes issues:

1. **Immediate:** Revert to Phase 2 (Shadow Evaluation)
2. **Log:** All violations during incident
3. **Analyze:** Root cause of false positive or negative side effect
4. **Fix:** Update law or implementation
5. **Re-validate:** Complete Phases 2–4 again
6. **Re-approve:** Human authorization for Phase 5
