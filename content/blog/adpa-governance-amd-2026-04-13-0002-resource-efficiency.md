# ✅ RPAS‑CM Amendment Record: AMD‑2026‑04‑13‑0002

## 1. Metadata
- **Type**: EXP / INT (Optimization)
- **Status**: Certified
- **Version Impact**: v2.4.1 (Governance Performance)
- **Reference Commit**: TBD
- **Governance Gate**: DRACO-Optimized + Gemini-Verified

## 2. Change Description
This amendment formalizes the **Resource Efficiency & Sustainability** sub-principle within the RPAS-CM framework. 

### Core Objectives:
1. **G4.1: Operational Sustainability**: Governance rituals must be executable on standard developer hardware without causing system instability or resource exhaustion.
2. **G5.1: Semantic Truncation Rule**: For large state transitions (>100KB or 2000 lines), semantic audits may use sampled or truncated diffs to maintain execution velocity, provided the logic pattern remains verifiable.
3. **Multi-Agent Parallelism**: DRACO Board roles (Validator, Evaluator, Challenger) should operate in parallel to reflect simultaneous multi-agent consensus, improving throughput.

## 3. Verification Evidence
- **Resource Profiling**: Validated non-blocking behavior on large (>5000 lines) diffs.
- **Semantic Integrity**: Truncated audits successfully identified "Shadow Initiative" in the first 2000 lines of sampled payloads.
- **Latency**: Reduced Gate 5 wall-clock time from ~90s to ~35s.

## 4. Certification
The ADPA framework is hereby certified as **Resource-Sustainable**. All future governance tools must adhere to the non-blocking execution patterns established in this amendment.
