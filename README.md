This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## RAG Chatbot with Google Gemini

This project includes a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot powered by Google's Gemini model. The chatbot can answer questions about the portfolio content by retrieving relevant information from blog posts, projects, and other content.

### Setup

1. Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.local.example` with your Google Cloud credentials:
   ```
   VERTEX_AI_API_URL=https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/gemini-pro:generateContent
   VERTEX_AI_EMBEDDING_API_URL=https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/textembedding-gecko:predict
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/your/service-account-key.json
   ```

2. Place your Google Cloud service account key file in the project root.

3. Ensure the RAG documents are generated by running the content extraction scripts:
   ```bash
   npm run extract-blog-content
   npm run extract-project-content
   ```

### Usage

1. Navigate to `/chat/rag-chat` to use the RAG-powered chatbot.
2. Ask questions about projects, blog posts, or skills mentioned in the portfolio.
3. The chatbot will retrieve relevant content and provide accurate answers based on the portfolio content.

### Development Mode

The chatbot includes a mock implementation for development purposes:

- When running in development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`), the chatbot will automatically use a mock implementation of the Gemini API
- This allows development and testing without consuming Vertex AI API credits
- You can also force the mock implementation by setting `USE_MOCK_GEMINI=true` in your environment
- The mock implementation will show a notice in the UI indicating that responses are simulated

### Features

- **Content-Grounded Responses**: All responses are based on actual portfolio content
- **Source Attribution**: View the sources used to generate each answer
- **Similarity Scores**: See how relevant each source is to your query
- **Conversation History**: The chatbot maintains context across multiple messages
- **Fallback Mode**: Automatically falls back to mock implementation if the Gemini API is unavailable
