# Azure SQL Integration Best Practices

This application follows Azure best practices for secure and performant SQL database access:

## Security Best Practices

1. **Connection String Security**
   - Connection strings are environment-specific and never committed to source control
   - Production uses Azure AD authentication ("Authentication=Active Directory Default")
   - Sensitive information stored in Azure KeyVault in production

2. **Least Privilege Access**
   - Application uses dedicated service user with minimal required permissions
   - Temporary credentials not stored in application code

3. **Data Protection**
   - Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled for data-at-rest encryption
   - Properly validates and sanitizes inputs to prevent SQL injection

## Performance Best Practices

1. **Query Optimization**
   - Uses AsNoTracking() for read-only operations
   - Implements split queries for complex joins
   - Properly indexes frequently queried columns

2. **Connection Efficiency**
   - Connection pooling configured
   - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Handles transient Azure SQL errors properly

3. **Monitoring and Diagnostics**
   - Application Insights integration for query performance monitoring
   - Health checks implementation for proactive database connectivity monitoring

## Dependency Management

1. **Known Security Issues**
   - Azure.Identity 1.11.0 has known vulnerability GHSA-m5vv-6r4h-3vj9
   - Plan to update when fixed version is available
   - Current mitigation: using managed identities minimizes the vulnerability impact

2. **Update Schedule**
   - Security updates applied monthly
   - Major dependency versions reviewed quarterly
