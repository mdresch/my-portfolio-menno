# Business Problem Statement

Our goal is to develop a comprehensive personal portfolio platform that enables users to showcase their projects, publish and manage blog content, and integrate with external developer services such as GitHub and Dev.to. The platform must provide a user-friendly editing experience, support rich content, offer analytics on user engagement, and ensure secure, scalable management of user data and integrations.
