# Chat Widget Setup & Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔧 Issue Resolution: AI Model Not Loading

The chat widget was showing error messages because the required API tokens for the AI service were not configured. This has been **resolved** with a graceful fallback system.

## ✅ Current Status

**FIXED**: The chat widget now works properly with intelligent fallback responses when AI services are unavailable.

### What Was Fixed:
- ❌ **Before**: Chat returned "Missing API token" errors
- ✅ **After**: Chat provides helpful, contextual responses even without AI service

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### 1. **Graceful Fallback System**
When AI services are unavailable, the chat provides intelligent responses based on message content:

- **Projects**: Directs users to the Projects section
- **Skills**: Points to the Skills/Technologies section  
- **Experience**: Guides to the About section
- **Contact**: Shows contact information location
- **Blog**: Highlights the Blog section
- **General**: Provides portfolio overview with navigation help

### 2. **Smart Content Detection**
The fallback system analyzes user messages and provides relevant responses:

```javascript
// Example responses:
"What projects are in this portfolio?" 
→ Detailed response about projects with navigation guidance

"How can I contact you?"
→ Information about contact methods and where to find them

"What technologies do you use?"
→ Overview of skills with direction to Skills section
```

## 🔑 Setting Up Full AI Functionality (Optional)

To enable the full AI assistant, you need to configure API tokens:

### Option 1: GitHub AI Models (Recommended)
```bash
# Set environment variable
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
# OR
export REQUIREMENTS_AGENT_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

### Option 2: Create .env.local file
```bash
# Create environment file
echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here" > .env.local
```

### Getting GitHub Token:
1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes: `repo`, `read:user`
4. Copy the token and set it as environment variable

## 🧪 Testing the Chat Widget

### 1. **Test Fallback Responses** (Works Now)
```bash
# Test project inquiry
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What projects are in this portfolio?"}]}'

# Test contact inquiry  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"How can I contact you?"}]}'
```

### 2. **Test in Browser**
1. Visit your portfolio: http://localhost:3000
2. Click the chat bubble (bottom-right corner)
3. Send any message - you'll get helpful responses!
