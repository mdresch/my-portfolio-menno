docs/RAG-CHATBOT-IMPLEMENTATION.md: # RAG Chatbot Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Google's Gemini model for the portfolio website.

## Implemented Components

### 1. RAG API Endpoint
- Created a new API endpoint at `/api/rag-chat/route.ts` that:
  - Loads RAG documents from JSON files
  - Generates embeddings for user queries using Vertex AI Embeddings API
  - Performs vector search to find relevant documents
  - Formats a system prompt with retrieved content
  - Communicates with Google's Gemini model via Vertex AI
  - Returns AI responses with metadata about sources

### 2. RAG Chat Interface
- Created a dedicated chat interface at `/app/chat/rag-chat/page.tsx` that:
  - Provides a clean, user-friendly interface
  - Shows source attributi
docs/KEEPING-RAG-CONTENT-FRESH.md: # Keeping RAG Content Fresh

This document explains how to keep your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot content up-to-date.

## Content Sources

The RAG chatbot uses content extracted from the following sources:

- Blog posts (`content/blog/*.md`)
- Projects (`content/project/*.md`) 
- Risk-related content

## Extraction Process

Content is extracted using three scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

1. `extract-blog-content.ts`: Processes blog post markdown files
2. `extract-project-content.ts`: Processes project markdown files
3. `extract-risk-content.ts`: Processes risk-related content

These scripts generate JSON files in the `data/` directory that are used by the RAG system:

- `data/blog-rag-documents.json`
- `data/project-rag-documents.json`
- `data/blog-rag-risk-documents.
